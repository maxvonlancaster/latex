Plug-ins and Add-ons for WinEdt
===============================

Plug-ins (Add-ons) provide extended (task specific) functionality
of WinEdt. I strongly encourage and welcome such contributions.
Furthermore, if the authors don't mind to receive some feedback
and are willing to support their contribution (for a while) they
should also include a short "Readme.txt" file describing the
purpose of their program, any credits, maintenance and copyright/
copyleft notices, and their e-mail address.

You can download currently available plug-ins from WinEdt's
Community Site:

There is no limit on what can be done with joint efforts!
