WinEdt 5.5 has been Reinstalled or Upgraded on your System
==========================================================

This is the default configuration (project file is not loaded
during the installation - it will be loaded after you restart
the program). To finish the installation upgrade proceed as
follows:

Start the Configuration Wizard (Options Menu):

  - Create or update additional Links and Shortcuts to WinEdt
  - (Optionally) Create or update any filetype associations
  - (Optionally) Create or Update your User Profile
  - Restart WinEdt


IMPORTANT: You should Update User Profile if you have
previously installed WinEdt and created a user profile for an
older version!


If you have upgraded over an older version of WinEdt and you
chose not to install the new default settings most of your old
settings have been preserved. You should, however, consider
loading a few updated default components if you want to take
advantage of new functionality. In particular, you should load
the new default Options Menu, Help Menu, and Background Schemes
(extended Highlighting Dialog). Such components (including
individual menus) can be chosen and installed from Options ->
Maintenance -> Default interface.

  HINT: As long as you have executed Options -> Maintenance ->
  Backup menu command you can switch between the new default
  settings and your custom (backed up) ones. The Restore menu
  item (in the same menu) provides the same interface as the
  "Default" one except that components are now imported from
  your Backup. Backup is never overwritten during WinEdt
  upgrades! It should be created before you install a new
  version over the old one (if preserving your old custom
  settings is a concern)...


IMPORTANT: Check the Configuration Wizard and its Help. It
explains how to configure and (if necessary) diagnose and
troubleshoot any problems with your TeX installation...
