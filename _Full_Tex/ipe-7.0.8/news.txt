--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.8 (2009-11-04) SVN 373

 * Option -show-configuration to show the current configuration on
   stdout. 

 * Recognize Mac OS and change some compilation flags in Makefiles.
 
 * FreeBSD and Mac OS do not support "install -t <dir>", and so
   invocations of "install" were changed to use the traditional syntax
   "install <files> <dir>".

 * Fixed wrong transformation matrix after path editing (bug #313).

 * New preference to set size of dialog to create/edit text objects.

 * Fixed crash during stylesheet add (bug #315). 

 * New shortcut "Ctrl+Return" to accept dialogs (useful in multi-line
   text input fields).

 * Enabled display of paper boundary during panning again.

 * Menu item for showing/hiding bookmarks.

 * Tooltips in "Properties" dock.
 
 * "Edit" button in stylesheets dialog to edit stylesheet using
   external editor.

 * Fixed mouse shortcuts (Shift+Right and Shift+Ctrl+Right didn't work
   properly).

 * Moved path join/cap/fill rule to the path property menu.

 * Added opacity and gradient pattern to path property menu.

 * Current settings indicated in path property menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.7 (2009-10-23) SVN 361

 * Removed -fno-exceptions and -fno-rtti from CXXFLAGS, to avoid
   surprises like bug #308.

 * Fixed broken interpretation of symbol/mark matrix (bug #310).

 * Fixed page numbering (bug #311).

 * Implemented "prefs.select_distance".

 * Fixed incorrect handling of line cap and line join (bug #312).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.6 (2009-10-23) SVN 359

 * Worked around Qt styling bug in QComboBox (bug #308).  Using
   QSignalMapper now to map signals (no derived classes).

 * LayerBox popup moved into Lua code.

 * Fixed renaming of active layers.

 * Fixed selection of objects in locked layers.

 * Function to check symbolic attributes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.5 (2009-10-22) SVN 357

 * Created script "svgtoipe.py" to convert SVG files to Ipe format.
   It is available as a separate download.

 * Made Lua interface for attribute values more robust - interface now
   checks that attributes have correct type before passing them to
   Ipelib.  This fixes opacity names starting with digits. 
   (Bug #2880502)

 * #define to enable use of ancient pdftex versions ( < 130).
   Bug #309.

 * Show current view and page number in the properties window.

 * Environment variable IPEQTSTYLE sets this Qt style.  Saying, for
   instance, 'export IPEQTSTYLE="cleanlooks" ' would fix the Qt crash
   in some styles on some systems. (See bug #308.)

 * Gradient support changed: gradients are now used as fill patterns
   for path objects.  Gradients can now have more than two color
   stops.
   The file format has changed slightly because of this, so the
   current file format version is 70005.   There is no support for
   reading 70000-version files with gradients.

 * Support base64-encoding for bitmaps in XML format.

 * Fixed views without active layer.

 * Fixed filename in autosave (bug #2883631).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.4 (2009-10-14) SVN 335

 * Fixed bug in save_as (bug #305).

 * ipe6upgrade: fixed empty dash.
 
 * Fixed handling of matrix in path join.

 * Added "arc" and "farc" arrow types.  When the final segment of a
   path is circular arc, then these arrows take on a shape that
   depends on the radius of the arc, as metafont arrows do.

 * Fixed handling of path objects with missing stroke and fill
   attributes. 

 * Added "presentation.isy" to styles directory.  You can now create a
   new presentation by saying "ipe -sheet presentation".

 * Fixed computation of bounding box of transformed text object.

 * Fixed handling of horizontal and vertical alignment and
   transformable text from Properties menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.3 (2009-10-10) SVN 318

 * Style sheets now looked for in IPESTYLES directory, so it suffices
   to say "ipe -sheet presentation" to create a new presentations.

 * Fixed cropped boundaries in iperender (bug #284).

 * "Save as" dialog will start in more sensible directory (can be
   customized, see prefs.save_as_directory).

 * Using Cairo font if Latex has not been run.

 * Fixed colorstack problem in Latex run, require Pdflatex 1.30.

 * Ipe can now create independent bounding boxes for each view.
   This is activated by creating a layer named "VIEWBBOX".

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.2 (2009-09-27) SVN 311

 * Path edit tool, including scissors and path join implemented.

 * Implemented clipping path operations for groups.

 * Several bugs fixed.

 * Implemented automatic angular snapping.

 * Included intersection snapping (from pre29).

 * Fixed Cairo glyph cache handling (bug #293).

 * Fixed snapping to ends of B-spline (bug #290).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.1 (2009-09-17) SVN 288

 * Path entry tool finished, can switch between spline and line mode
   and handle quadratic and cubic Bezier splines and circular arcs.

 * If Ipe is called with a non-existing file as an argument, it will
   not show an error message but remember the file for the next save.

 * Mark shape selection moved to properties window.

 * Added $(INSTALL_ROOT) variable to Makefiles for packaging.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.0 (2009-09-16) SVN 282
 
 * Most of Ipe was rewritten entirely.

 * Group object can now have a clipping path.

 * User-defined marks and arrows can be defined in a style sheet.

 * Gradients, tilings, and transparency added.

 * Standard style settings are no longer hardwired into Ipe. 
   Everything is defined in loadable stylesheets.

 * Mouse button shortcuts have been changed.  Right mouse button is
   now always the popup menu. 

 * Using Cairo library for rendering Ipe documents, Qt for the user
   interface, and Lua as a scripting language.  The entire high-level
   Ipe model is written in Lua.

 * Namespaces ipe, ipeqt, ipeui, ipelua.

 * C++ method names now start with a lowercase letter.

 * Mark object removed (it is now implemented using symbols).

 * Ipeextract can open any Ipe file (any version of Ipe 6 or 7) and
   extract the XML stream. Ipeextract can help to recover files that
   are unreadable due to an Ipe bug.

 * There were many small changes in the file format during the
   lifetime of Ipe 6, and it was becoming cumbersome (and buggy) to
   keep Ipe able to read all these various versions.  Ipe 7.0 has a
   fresh format, and a separate program ipe6upgrade is used to convert
   from Ipe 6 to Ipe 7 format.

 * The grid has been replaced by graph paper.

 * Ipetopng was replaced by iperender, which can produce output in PNG
   and in SVG.  SVG output can be used to embed scalable Ipe figures
   in webpages.  Iperender does not need to be linked with a GUI
   toolkit and requires no X server, so it can easily be used on a
   webserver (to convert Latex source to images or SVG art).

 * Ipe now fails gracefully on incorrect XML input.

 * Painter now has a drawArc primitive.  Circular arcs on the screen
   should now be accurate even at high zoom. (PDF and Postscript
   output still needs to approximate using splines, though.)

 * Text "transformable" attribute replaced by general
   "transformations" attribute. Any object can be restricted to
   translations only or rigid motions only.

 * Ipe now runs creates temporary directory for running latex under
   Windows in user's local APPDATA directory.

 * Ipe XML format contains DOCTYPE declaration, and "ipe.dtd" is
   provided. 

 * Ipetoipe, ipe6upgrade, ipeextract guess output filename if it is
   not provided.

 * Appearance of page numbers on the page can be customized in the
   style sheet.

 * Text for latex conversion is now written out in UTF-8, and it is
   assumed that Pdflatex can handle that (using a suitable package,
   either "inputenc" or "CJK").

 * Ipe symbols can be used as the "bullet" in itemize environments etc.

 * Path objects can be drawn using a pen on a tablet PC.

 * New alignment modes to distribute centers and sides equally.

 * Latex and XML code can now be edited using an external editor.

 * Support for subpixel information from a tablet (but still
   completely untested).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 32 patch 1 (2009-04-30)

 * Fixed writing floating point numbers again (bug #279).

 * Qt 4.5 breaks setting locale (bug #281).

 * Fixed broken \rule (bug #268).

 * Removed check against freetype version.  It breaks Ipe whenever
   distributions upgrade freetype, and seems no longer necessary.  In
   principle, freetype should provide upwards binary compatibility.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 32 (2008-12-01)

 * Fixed writing floating point numbers (bug #274).

 * Fixed compilation with Qt 4.2 (bug #272).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 31 (2008-11-04)

 * Fixed display of mathematical symbols and rules (bugs #253, #268).

 * ANSI C now requires printf to obey the locale.  Since the Ipe file
   format must be locale independent, we just set the numeric locale
   to "C" until it becomes clear how ANSI C wants programs to write
   locale independent data files (bug #263).

 * Ipe now tries hard not to write numbers in the "1e-3" format that
   PDF and Postscript do not understand (bug #209).

 * Correctly handle & in page titles and section headings (bug #240).

 * Fixed incorrect label for "Turn 90 degrees" and "Turn 270 degrees"
   ipelets (bug #244).

 * Some changes for g++ 4.3 (bug #265).

 * Ipe5toxml now distributed separately.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 30 (2007-11-27)

 * Ipe now works with pdftex 1.40 (in MikTeX 2.6 and texlive 2007).

 * Pascal-Nicolas Becker, Frederik Hermans, and Damian Schmidt
   implemented the missing forms of intersection snapping (for arcs
   and Bezier curves), with bug fix by Jonathan Backer.

 * Fixed the broken user interface (fields were too small to contain
   the text) on Unix (removed a static QFont) (bug #191).

 * Figtoipe now distributed separately.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 28 (2006-12-23)

 * To allow for interesting styles that can be applied at will and
   exchanged to change the look of a presentation, there were several
   changes. The "layout" now defines the size of the paper and the
   'frame', a rectangular area where (most) drawing on a page will
   occur. The origin of the Ipe coordinate system is the lower left
   corner of the frame (no longer of the paper).  The frame can be
   anywhere on the paper, and is displayed with a dotted line on the
   screen.  The layout is specified in the style sheet (and so the
   paper size can no longer be changed from the UI).

 * Antialiasing now also works on systems without X Render extension.

 * Pages can now have a title (Page/Edit title and sections).  If a 
   title is set, it is displayed on the page as defined in the style
   sheet. 

 * Objects can now be pinned horizontally, vertically, or entirely.

 * Ipe no longer makes a distinction between 'textbox' and
   'minipage'.  The function "Insert textbox" actually inserts a
   'minipage', set to cover the entire width of the frame and
   horizontally pinned, with transformable set to false.

 * Textstretch is now a single scalar.

 * Snapping now recognizes the corners and the boundary of paper and
   frame.

 * New alignment functions: left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and
   left-and-right, top-and-bottom.

 * New "Properties" menu, where the properties not in the properties
   panel can be set and changed (en masse).  Mark shape and
   transformable text have been moved here.

 * The layout of the properties panel can now be selected from three
   variants (one row, one column, and two columns as before).

 * Added "Change text width" to "Edit" menu (and a shortcut key).

 * Coordinate display shows units.

 * Automatic angular snap is now in force during moving.

 * Ipe now requires Qt 4.2 or higher (Qmake has silently changed its
   quoting syntax) (bug #176).

 * Moved layer renaming to layer list and fixed problem (bug #187).

 * New functions for moving to/selecting all in any layer.

 * Added -from and -to options to ipetoipe.

 * Fixed display of bitmaps in Background template in PDF output.

 * Fixed crash when a style sheet containing a template was updated.

 * Fixed paste-undo-undo crash (bug #198).
 
 * Ipetopng no longer needs an X server.

 * Hopefully fixed the bug that caused keyboard shortcuts to not work
   sometimes.  

 * Save and restore toolbar state (bug #197).

 * When the page is empty, "Fit objects" does a "Fit frame".

 * Removed canvas tooltip again.  It was too annoying.

 * Added "Move" ipelet by Gunter Schenck to distribution (bug #53).

 * Added "Euclidean Geometry" ipelet by Jari Lappalainen to
   distribution. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 27 (2006-09-26)

 * Function to update all style sheets of the document from external
   style sheet files (with matching names in the same directory as the
   Ipe document). 

 * Mark objects can now be filled (for type 'Box' and 'Circle') (bug
   #139).

 * Text style now accessible through popup menu.

 * Text size can now be set while creating text object.

 * Option -styleupdate for "ipetoipe".

 * New functions to move objects forward/backward more precisely (bug #144).

 * Can now select display of mouse position in points, inches, or
   millimeters (bug #156).

 * Removed the inclusion of additional directories to the Latex source
   path. It didn't work in a portable way, and I don't think it's very
   useful.  Fixes problems with MikTex 2.5 (bug #179).

 * Double buffering is now a preference.  It seems not to work on some
   (Linux) systems.

 * Disable canvas tooltip while drawing.

 * Text in Background template works now.

 * Fixed double vertex in regular k-gon.

 * Ipetoipe showed number of pages, not number of views, when testing
   for conversion to EPS (bug #155).

 * Fixed display of size (not an integer) in ipetopng (bug #155).

 * Fixed warning when compiling ipestdfonts with GCC 4.2 (bug #159).

 * Fixed inclusion of JPG images with zero resolution.

 * Last line in minipage environments is terminated with a LF now.

 * Save as bitmap now uses anti-aliasing (bug #138).
 
 * Fixed warnings on unused return values (bug #169, #170).

 * Changed project type of ipelets to plugin (bug #171).

 * Fixed rendering bug for text (bug #146).

 * Added "Reset Direction" function (bug #140).

 * Fixed crash when path started with zero length segment followed by
   circle arc (bug #145).

 * Reading and writing through Qt is now explicitely buffered (bug
   #162).

 * Fixed duplicated control point when joining paths to form a closed
   loop (bug #133).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 26 (2005-12-14)

 * Added visibility polygon ipelet by Chris Gray.

 * Anti-aliasing enabled for lines and edges (this is controlled by
   the preference setting for anti-aliasing fonts).  Enabled
   double-buffering.

 * Changed how key assignments are defined.  Key assignments can be
   easily customized by editing an XML file.  Keyboard shortcuts can
   be defined for any Ipelet as well.
   
 * Changed "default" text style back to Latex default style (justified).

 * Fixed matrix problem in smallest-circle ipelet.

 * Fixed "pan here" (bug #119).

 * Fixed cancellation of color dialog (bug #121).

 * Added "About ipelets" to display proper credits for code used in
   ipelets. 

 * Virtual destructors to make g++ 4 happy.

 * Changed rendering of text (using QPainter::drawImage).

 * Fixed bug #122 (shortcuts for actions were not disabled during
   drawing). 

 * Fixed bug #123 (Fifi bleeding).

 * Fixed default setting of editor font (bug #131).
 
 * Fixed problem in JPEG importing on systems where char is signed.

 * Starting to make snapshots available between releases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 25 (2005-11-24)

 * Migrated to Qt 4.0.0 and switched to MinGW compiler on Windows.

 * Added smallest enclosing circle ipelet written by Chris Gray to the
   distribution.

 * Removed the 'Postscript' file format.  The three Ipe file formats
   are now XML, PDF, and EPS.

 * 'void' is no longer allowed as a stroke color.  To draw objects
   without boundary, use the new 'void' line style.  This model allows
   for arrows without tails, and avoids problems with invisible text
   and marks.

 * If the style sheet contains a template with name "Background", this
   template will automatically be shown on each page.  There is no
   need to explicitely create a reference on each page anymore. 
   This replaces the old "background" layer + reference mechanism.

 * Templates containing bitmaps are now supported (bug #100).

 * Minipage objects now have a "Latex style" - common Latex
   environments can be used that way without having to type them every
   time.

 * When Ipe displays the Latex log file, it highlights the errors and
   scrolls automatically to the first one.

 * Ipe can now number pages visibly in the PDF output.

 * Resolution of bitmaps displayed on screen now configurable.

 * Default line cap, line join, and fill rule can now be defined in
   the style sheet.  Object menu now shows them
   correctly (enhancement #79).

 * Ipe XML files can now have extension ".ipe" (enhancement #92).

 * Changes to stroke color of text objects are displayed immediately. 

 * Option -runlatex for Ipetoipe (enhancement #88).

 * Loading and saving alternative formats replaced by auto-exporting.

 * Ipe XML parser now silently skips all tags whose name starts with
   "x-". This allows you to make XML files with more information, to
   be shared between other programs and Ipe (enhancement #110).

 * -nocolor option for ipetoipe (enhancement #107).

 * 'media' attribute is now in the <info> element, where it should have
   been all along.

 * Fixed building RPM from source RPM (bug #98, thanks to Laurent
   Rineau).

 * Fixed -lastview option in ipetoipe (introduced in pre23 but didn't
   actually work...)

 * No more support for KDE (it doesn't use Qt 4).

 * Fixed bug #86 (incorrect XML for textsize).

 * Fixed bug #116 (error in IpeBezier::Straight).

 * XML comments now use correct syntax <!-- ... --> .

 * "Ipe5toxml" is no longer automatically called.

 * Fixed bug #103 (comment in last line of text object).

 * Recognize alternative names of standard fonts used in libwmf (bug
   #109).

 * Fixed bug #77 (spaces in layer names).
 
 * Fixed bug #83 (editing a path lost arrows).

 * Fixed bug #102 (bookmark destinations were wrong).

 * Fixed bug #96 (vertical text caused Acrobat to fail opening PDF).

 * Removed handling of obsolete Ipe file versions in IpeImlParser.

 * A subpath consisting of a single moveto no longer causes Ipe to
   crash (but to fail an assertion).

 * Fixed bug #74 (New layer, new view keeps view settings).

 * "Last page" now goes to last page (not second-to-last one).

 * Snapping to center of arc works now.
 
 * Changed computation of dimmed colors (Qt's definition doesn't dim
   black at all).

 * Intersection snapping now works inside groups.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 23 (2004-11-22)

 * Option for ipetoipe to save last view of each page only (#69).

 * Fixed bug #70 (wrong filename for ipe5toxml)

 * Fixed bug #71 (compiler warning in qvoronoi.cpp)

 * Fixed ASCII85 encoder (if # bytes was multiple of 4, no EOD marker
   was generated).  Caused errors in Ghostscript, as reported by Jirka
   Matousek. 

 * Bug #72 appears to be fixed.

 * Fixed bug #67 (splinegons with less than 3 control points).

 * Fixed bug #65 (changing attributes and visibility of layers does
   not cause "edited" status of page to be changed).

 * Added "figtoipe", an auxiliary program that converts figures in FIG
   format (as created by xfig) to Ipe format.

 * Fixed filename of "ipe5toxml" in Unix build.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 22 (2004-09-07)

 * Fixed crash when cutting the only page.

 * Fixed handling of mark size, text size and mark shape in group
   objects. 

 * Fixed bug #59: pasting didn't work on Unix.

 * Fixed bug #64: undo wasn't properly cleared.

 * Fixed bug #58: "Edit object" now in Edit menu.

 * Fixed enabling/disabling of keyboard shortcuts for edit menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 21

 * Fixed compilation on some Debian architectures.

 * Corrected default location of manpages (.../share/man/man1)

 * Saving page labels in PDF file.

 * Revised handling of shortcut keys completely.  Shortcuts should now
   be recognized in any situation.

 * Fixed bug #54: Selecting objects no longer first snaps the cursor
   position.

 * Fixed bug #55: Edit path didn't show your options when started.

 * Don't create CropBox/ArtBox for entirely empty pages (crashes
   gpdf).

 * Added sections and subsections for multi-page documents (shown as
   "Bookmarks" in PDF readers).

 * Documented environment variables in man pages and manual.

 * Members of IpeView are now private.

 * Added -noshading option to ipetoipe.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 20
 
 * It now works to copy objects between Ipe and Emacs on Unix as
   well. 

 * Added <cmap> tag to style sheet.

 * Fixed behavior of "stretch" on aligned mouse movements (also fixes
   bug #49).

 * Fixed crash in "Fit objects" when width or height is zero.

 * Fixed Postscript rendering of objects where stroke and fill color
   are identical (and not black).

 * Fixed rounding behavior of resolution when zooming in and out.

 * Fixed deletion of layer.

 * Removed hiding of layers.  The difference between a hidden layer
   and a layer not in the current view was too confusing.

 * Page tools hidden when only one view exists.

 * Fixed rendering of selection on Unix.

 * Fixed oversized color tools.

 * Made grid size an integer.

 * Showing relative coordinates as well as absolute ones.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 19 (2004-06-30)

 * Fixed crash in scissors.

 * Removed IPEDATADIR from options.

 * Moved documentation to /usr/share/doc in RPMs.

 * Generate /ToUnicode character maps if Cyberbit is used. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 18 (2004-06-28)

 * Fixed crash when creating circle through three points.

 * Compilation against KDE libraries supported.  This only adds very
   rudimentary KDE support, for instance Ipe now correctly switches
   style when the theme is changed in the KDE control center.

 * All personal Ipe configuration files are now in $HOME/.ipe

 * Added -debug command line flag.

 * Building source RPM and binary RPM for Fedora Core 2. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 17 (2004-06-25)

 * Added man pages.

 * Fixed incorrect call to putenv (glibc has changed the semantics).

 * Removed dependence on Xpdf. Ipelib now contains the necessary code
   to parse and produce PDF as well as Postscript, so Ipelib clients
   can open any kind of Ipe document.

 * Removed pdftoipe from main Ipe distribution and packaged separately
   (it's still contained in the Windows distribution).

 * Fixed enormous memory leak in Ipebitmap destructor.

 * Directory for documentation is now configurable separately (for
   systems such as Debian where the natural place for documentation is
   in /usr/share/doc/ipe).

 * Ipe now displays current mouse position in user coordinates.

 * Split ipetoipe and ipetopng.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 16 (2004-06-05)

 * Ipetoipe was not installed.

 * Ipe could not load its own figures because of a stupid typo.

 * Fixed a bug in scissors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 15 (2004-06-04)

 * Color changes in text objects (e.g. made using \textcolor) and
   quotient bars are now shown on screen.

 * Views (that is, page views) are now fully integrated in Ipe's main
   user interface. They are easier to create and maintain.

 * Views keep a record of the active layer, so that switching back to
   a view to edit it makes objects go in the right layer (usually).

 * Pressing the right mouse button in the layer list opens a context
   menu.

 * Changed handling of style-sheet stretching of text objects.  The
   width/depth/height of text objects now correctly reflects this
   stretching, and when creating a minipage object, the user drags out
   the actual desired width.  

   Unfortunately, this changes the semantics of Ipe documents!  To
   make it possible to do this change automatically, the style sheet
   tag has been renamed from <textmatrix> to <textstretch> (with
   slightly changed syntax, see the manual).  Currently, a simple
   automatic conversion is done: if the style sheet contains ANY
   textmatrix tag, the conversion factor is applied to the width of
   ALL text objects in the document.

 * Simple background shadings are now possible using <shading> in a
   style sheet.

 * Two new types of text objects defined.  They are just variants of
   label and minipage.  A new function 'Insert text object' creates
   textbox objects with fixed left and right margins (set in the style
   sheet).

 * Move-to-back function now inserts in front of anything in
   background layer.

 * Renamed the method NotifyStyle to CheckStyle.  

 * Added a simple clipping ipelet (clips only marks and line segments
   to a convex polygon - just about enough to be useful for clipping
   Voronoi diagrams).

 * Fixed bug #42 (linewidth could be null in IpeBBoxPainter).

 * Ipe remembers file format used for saving. 

 * Latex style files are now searched for both in the current
   directory and in the directory containing the Ipe document.

 * Command line option -geom WxH+X+Y (note the slight difference to
   X11, where the option is '-geometry').  Smarter zoom on opening
   documents. 

 * Simplified handling of locked layers.  A locked layer cannot be
   made the active layer now.

 * Each page stores the grid size used to create it.

 * Only one (global) media size per Ipe document.

 * Refactored Ipe program into separate model/canvas library.  
   The Ipe canvas can be reused by programs wishing to display Ipe
   data. 

 * Ipe file format conversion functionality (-topng, -topdf etc) has
   been moved into a separate program "ipetoipe".

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 14 (2004-04-30)

 * Changed display of grid as requested by Sariel Har-Peled.

 * Fixed bug #40 (atan2 DOMAIN bug on zero-length segments).

 * Changed to using dynamic Borland RTL (cc3250.dll)

 * Finally libipe is compiled as a DLL on Windows as well.

 * Fixed bug #28 again, differently, and hopefully really...

 * Disabled pasting bitmaps on Windows version - Qt crashes on certain
   bitmaps (perhaps GIF format bitmaps??)

 * Fixed serious bug that stopped Ipe from opening any figure
   containing bitmaps. 

 * Fixed problem with templates not defined in current style sheet.

 * New 'templates' ipelet with simple functionality for making
   backgrounds for presentations.

 * Fixed bug #37 (Ipe now more accurately computes the bounding box
   stored in PDF output).

 * Added setting for infinite-edge length to qvoronoi ipelet, and
   fixed a crash when it is called without any sites.

 * Fixed divide by zero crash in arc drawing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 13 (2004-04-20)

 * Official Windows Ipe distribution is now compiled with free Borland
   C++ compiler.

 * Changed license to allow linking with CGAL.

 * In preferences dialog, one can now set the initial grid visibility,
   window maximizing, default paper size, and the default style sheet.

 * Style sheets can now define LaTeX preamble pieces.

 * Command line option to add a style sheet to new document.

 * "Insert image" moved to file menu, added inserting from clipboard.
   Ctrl+V will now paste a bitmap from the clipboard.

 * Fixed bug #1 (copied text has wrong textmatrix).
 
 * Fixed display of arrows on non-solid lines.

 * Fixed bug #13 (Symbolic attributes missing in the style sheet no
   longer cause Ipe to crash).

 * XML parser slightly improved, accepts XML comments <-- XXX -->.

 * Ipe now compiles on two different compilers without warnings.

 * Invisible text objects no longer break latex run.

 * Fixed bug #28 (Ipe5toxml couldn't run).

   should compile with Forte C++ now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 12 (2003-11-18)

 * Fixed bug #24: A pdfTeX/pdfeTeX mixup that stopped Ipe from working
   with MikTeX 2.4.

 * Documentation wasn't installed correctly.

 * According to Stefan Langerman, Mac OS X 10.3 changes name
   convention for dynamic libraries.  Fixed in Ipe.

 * Fixed bug #18. The directory containing the Ipe file is now
   searched for Latex style files. (When using the -topdf etc options,
   the current directory is searched.)

 * Fixed bug #20, creation of arc/circle through three collinear
   points.

 * Added feature #22 (loading and modifying files for which pdf and
   eps versions exist).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 11 (2003-11-06)

 * Patches by Stefan Langerman for Mac OS X.

 * Ipe installation automated with "make install".

 * Fixed serious problem that caused Ipe figures to crash printer or
   previewer when circles/arcs where used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 10 (2003-04-14)

   sheet).

 * Copy and paste for images fixed. 

 * Copy and paste for whole pages implemented.

 * Ipe is now usable with two-button mouse (see manual section "Mouse
   shortcuts")

 * Images will only be embedded once, even if they have been inserted
   several times from the same file.

 * Using system fontmap if available, otherwise allow installer to
   specify Ipe fontmap.  See "install.txt" for instructions.

 * Style sheet dialog.

 * Anti-aliased text.

 * Can change font of Latex source input fields.

 * Zoom spinbox buttons behave more reasonably.

 * Keyboard shortcuts for ipelets possible (and used by align ipelet)

   redisplay.

 * Reference point of text objects can be chosen, including baseline position.

 * Edit and Ungroup now available in Edit menu.

 * Ipelet/Align supports baseline alignment.

 * Pasting text creates a text object.

 * Displaying closed paths on-screen uses line-join properly now.

 * When saving a file, Ipe runs Pdflatex only if it's necessary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 9 (2003-03-26)

 * Compression option in Preferences is now a single checkbox.

 * Function to save current page as bitmap (can also be called from
   command line as -topng).

 * Fixed behaviour when switching between absolute and symbolic
   attributes. Introduced separate switch for grid size and angle.

 * Fixed masks for toolbar icons.

 * Finished handling of images.  They are now finally embedded
   efficiently in PDF documents (that is, not once in PDF format and
   once in XML format).

 * Text objects can now be transformed (rotated, stretched, and scaled).

 * Support for magnified text in presentations (see section on Style
   Sheets in the manual). 

 * Fixed size selection of Ipe window on start-up.

 * Goodies ipelet: Function "Create mediabox" added.

 * Support for Ipe localization added. Can also be used to change the
   keyboard shortcuts.

 * Fixed origin of stretch/scale.

 * "Select all" retains primary selection.

 * Keyboard shortcuts can be configured (see section "Customizing Ipe"
   in the manual).  

 * Width of paragraph objects can be changed (in object menu).

 * Snapping functions F3 and Shift-F3 implemented.

 * In snapping functions F1 and F2, angular snapping is now off.

 * Object menu button finds near object if primary selection is far
   from mouse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 7 (2003-03-14)

 * Voronoi diagram ipelet

 * Invisible layers are hidden in default PDF presentation

 * Zlib no longer included in source distribution, upgraded to zlib
   1.1.4 in Windows distribution.

 * Text objects have no snapping.

 * Inserting JPEG images is now supported.

 * Inserting bitmap images compresses the bitmap (makes PDF, EPS, and
   XML files smaller).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 4 (2003-02-28)

 * First public release of Ipe 6.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 5.0 August 15, 1994

 * rewrote Ipe to run under the X window system, and ported to 
   HP7xx systems and Sun SparcStations.

 * the user interface is now based on Motif.

 * there are two versions of the canvas, one using gl and my
   previous code, the other using plain X calls. This version,
   however, needs to allocate a large number of color cells to
   implement an overlay plane with double buffering (which gives much
   smoother drawing).

 * added fields showing the name of the last operation and the
   keyboard shortcut.

 * the Ium interface now handles -input and -file, and is capable of
   making this persistent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 4.1 July 5, 1994

 * fixed bugs introduced with the transition to PLAGEO 2.0.

 * changed calling of Iums so that the same Ipe binary works under
   irix 4.0.5 and irix 5.x.

 * the windows are now redrawn while loading and saving files.

 * moved more complicated Iums out of standard Ipe distribution and
   put the documentation on my www page (the world wide Ipe home
   page), instead of in the Ipe documentation. This will make it
   easier and more convenient to update the set of Iums for non-local
   users.

 * the executable for a Ium is now required to have the file extension
   .ium.

 * the height of the bounding box shown for minipages is now computed
   through LaTeX. Only the width is part of the minipage's definition.

 * added Segments object type, to compactify Ipe files containing lots
   of strokes of the same type (which typically arise in mechanically
   created drawings).

 * fixed up manual and index.

 * added blueadj and display options for mipe.cls.

 * changed style files and documentation to conform to LaTeX2e.

 * font sizes are now defined as floats, so we can use real LaTeX font sizes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Ipe 4.0 March 8, 1994

 * the Ipe file format is now at the same time an encapsulated
   Postscript file (eps), and it can be included without any package
   support. The style file ipe.sty is now only necessary for
   scaling or other non-standard behavior.

 * Text and Mark objects can now be invisible, like any other
   object.

 * when creating a Minipage object, you first have to drag out a
   bounding rectangle.

 * when previewing a single page that does not contain any text
   object, Latex is not run anymore.

 * introduced UndoLimit configuration variable and statistics function
   (in misc menu).

 * fixed treatment of linewidth for Postscript importing.

 * made changes necessary to use PLAGEO 2.0.

 * while loading a file, the new Latex preamble is now already in
   effect. But: this is now also true when inserting a file.  After
   insertion, the preamble of the containing file is used again.  This
   may become confusing.

 * the center of the drawing is now mapped to (300bp,400bp), so that
   printing the Ipe file directly will roughly center it on a4 or
   letter style paper.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 3.2 February 10, 1994

 * made Ipe into a ``package'' (this concerns some changes in
   our local installation.)

 * the manual is now in a reasonable shape

 * added ``Ipe user objects'', the possibility to specify an
   Ipe file as a ``user macro''.

 * added "With Prologue" button and code.

 * added arrows for splines (back). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 3.1 February 1, 1994

 * rewrote the spline code. Ipe now has a full spline object
   type, supports snapping to splines, and has a clearer interface.

 * the pop up bit-planes are now managed via redraw events. The
   interface is much clearer. Made colors that are used in pop up
   planes user-definable.

 * added directional snapping modes.

 * made mouse-explainer work for forms objects and with Shift and Ctrl
   keys.

 * put documentation in html document.

 * added some Ipe user macros for handling bitmaps, based on the "lug"
   graphics utilities library by Raul Rivero.

 * changed handling for calling Iums. Ipe will now redraw while
   waiting for a Ium to finish, and the ESC button can be used to
   cancel a Ium.

 * added a Ium for polygon approximation.

 * added reading and writing of raw bitmaps when communicating with
   Iums.

 * added a contour tracer for the Bitmap Ipe user macro.

 * added MakeBackups option.

 * when Ipe is killed and the drawing is not saved, Ipe will now
   save it in #unsaved.ipe#.

 * added Iums to call imged, imgworks, and xpaint.

 * "preview page" and "preview all" now use different temporary files,
   so they will not collide any more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 3.0 January 1, 1994

 * fixed bug in Postscript prologue that made coexistence of ipe.sty and
   epsf.sty in same LaTeX-file difficult

 * Now Ipe does not crash anymore when the Ghostscript window is
   deleted from the window manager. The next time that preview is
   called, a new Ghostscript window is created.

 * revised the handling of keyboard and menu events. They are now
   table-driven, and controlled by a single subroutine.

 * reintroduced the Zoom & Pan mode for synchronizing the Ghostscript
   window. It is much more convenient than the fully dynamic mode.

 * added a documented .iperc file format. Ipe will no longer start up
   without such a configuration file (but you can specify a different
   one using the -n flag).

 * Line widths, font sizes, grid sizes and the like are now all
   defined in the configuration file. There is no new line style
   function anymore, and no save configuration option.  All counters
   are replaced by choice objects.

 * added type-driven selection mode. If the Ctrl key is pressed when
   selecting objects with the right mouse button, only objects of the
   currently active type are considered. The same works for M-C-a.

 * added interface to Ipe user macros, and moved several rarely used
   functions and the import functions into Iums.

 * export Idraw has disappeared for the time being. I have never
   actually used this feature yet, and it's a mess, since all
   interesting pictures have some elements that Idraw doesn't
   understand.

 * wrote several pretty simple Iums based on existing plageo or leda
   code. Currently available are convex hulls, Voronoi diagrams, and
   clipping of polygonal objects.

 * revised the snapping concept, introduced priorities, and made
   peaceful coexistence of angular and boundary snapping possible.

 * Rotate, Scale, and Stretch are now available using a modifier key
   and the mouse. Their buttons have disappeared, since these
   operations are not actually object types, and there should not be
   such an ``object type.''

 * added delete function, that deletes objects without placing them in
   the cut buffer.

 * added keys C-d and r for the polygonal objects edit mode, and key
   C-d for line entry.

 * there is now a panning function. This was necessary because of the
   multi-page mode, were the template has to remain aligned with
   respect to all pages.

 * the snap to intersection point function now recognizes self
   intersections of polygonal chains. Also added a button to control
   snapping to object itself during editing and entry of polygonal
   objects.

 * added Fifi, a little marker that accompanies the cursor and shows
   the current snapping.

 * Ipe now does not crash anymore when the background Latex process
   for finding bounding boxes wants to read another file.

 * added bitmap object type, and a Ium to read in Silicon Graphics
   .rgb format files as bitmaps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 2.4 December 3, 1993

 * fixed bug in text yank that made Ipe crash

 * added multi-page mode

 * when undo is turned off in the configuration panel, the storage
   currently used by the undo buffer is released

 * the saved properties now do not contain a description of the data.
   If you use the edit properties function, you are supposed to know
   what you are doing.

 * changed keyboard shortcuts to cohere to IES (International Emacs
   Standard)

 * changed layout of configuration form to fit better with main form

 * added configuration option to disable drawing of filled
   splines. This is much faster than the default behavior.

 * Zoom now has a logarithmic scale, and different interface.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 2.3 August 11, 1993

 * scale and rotate now use center of object by default.

 * fixed bug in precise scale

 * added second input mode for arcs, using center of circle

 * added arrows on arcs

 * made Latex preamble for previewing and printing user-definable

 * bounding box for text objects is now computed by Latex

 * fixed two severe bugs that caused Ipe to eat up memory

 * put help information into a Texinfo file

 * made Control-middle button shortcut for scale/stretch

 * added Ghostscript previewer that runs in background

 * added importing Postscript files

 * changed all fixed limits to rerays, to make sure that arbitrary
   Postscript files that can be read won't make Ipe crash

 * allow filled non-simple polygons

 * added snapping to intersection points

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 2.2 August 1, 1993

 * added circular arc object type

 * added minipage version of text objects

 * added support for splines.

 * circles now behave properly when stretched and become ellipses

 * more color buttons, click with left and right mouse for fill and
   stroke

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 2.1 July 28, 1993

 * snapping to other objects

 * viewing and editing object properties

 * parameter form to change the configuration

 * changed layout of form

 * added icons for object type buttons

 * added field showing arrow/line style choice

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 2.0 July 14, 1993

 * This is the first version of Ipe. It is version 2.0 to distinguish
   the Ipe file format from the format generated by "ipefy".

--------------------------------------------------------------------
