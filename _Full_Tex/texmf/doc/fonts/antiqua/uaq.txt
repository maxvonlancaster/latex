This bundle includes the "URW Antiqua Regular Condensed"
Type1 font and all required files to use it with LaTeX on
the Un*x or PC platform.

"URW Antiqua Regular Condensed" is a single font from URW's
typeface family "URW Antiqua" and is available for free.

The below installation instructions assume a TDS-compliant
TeX system, such as teTeX, MikTeX or VTeX/Free.  Yet they
may not exactly fit your particular TeX system; please,
consult also its documentation as to installing additional
fonts and macros.


Installing the Type1 font file
------------------------------
The Type1 font file

  uaqr8ac.pfb

is to be copied to the directory

  texmf/fonts/type1/urw/antiqua

of your TeX system, and the related .afm file should go
into

  texmf/fonts/afm/urw/antiqua

You may need to create these directories first.  

NB:  The directory name "texmf" refers to the root directory
of the TDS directory tree.  In case your TeX systems has
more than one such directory tree, the documentation should
tell you where to install new files.


Installing the TeX support files from the archive uaq.zip
---------------------------------------------------------
Unpack the ZIP archive uaq.zip in the directory "texmf" of
your TeX system; thus, all files will be copied to the
appropriate directories.  


Configuring your TeX system
---------------------------
The programs of your TeX system must be configured to 
use a font map file for the additional font.  
The required actions vary according to your TeX system.
There are different sets of instructions provided for

  * teTeX-1.0 and teTeX-beta before June 2002,
  * teTeX-2.0 and later, teTeX-beta as of 6/2002 and later,
  * VTeX/Free,
  * other TDS-compliant TeX systems, for instance fpTeX,
    MikTeX or emTeX/TDS.


Configuring teTeX-1.0 (or teTeX-beta before June 2002)
------------------------------------------------------
Additional font map files are installed using the shell
script "updmap".  Add a record for uaq.map to the variable
extra_modules in the shell script texmf/dvips/config/updmap:

  extra_modules="
    uaq.map
    ... possibly further records ... 
  "
Enter the directory texmf/dvips/config/updmap and execute
the changed shell script:

   cd texmf/dvips/config
   ./updmap

In case the "updmap" script in your teTeX system has no
"extra_modules" variable or does not exist at all, please
refer to the below section "Configuring other TDS-compliant
TeX systems".


Configuring teTeX-2.0 and later 
(or teTeX-beta as of June 2002 and later)
-----------------------------------------
Additional font map files are installed using the shell
script "updmap".  Execute the following commands:

  texhash
  updmap --enable Map uaq.map


Configuring VTeX/Free (v7.00 and later)
---------------------------------------
Make VTeX read the additional font map ("aliasing") file
uaq.ali.  This is usually accomplished by putting a record
for uaq.ali into each of the configuration files

  texmf/vtex/config/pdf.fm
and
  texmf/vtex/config/ps.fm

The name "uaq.ali" is to be added to the TYPE1 section of
the above-mentioned files:

TYPE1 {
  ...
  uaq.ali
  }


Configuring other TDS-compliant TeX systems
-------------------------------------------
After unpacking of the archive file uaq.zip, a font map file
uaq.map for the URW Antiqua font resides in the directory
texmf/dvips/config.  It works for both dvips and pdfTeX.

dvips:  
Make dvips read the additional font map file uaq.map.  This
is usually accomplished by adding the line

p +uaq.map

to the dvips configuration file.  With teTeX, fpTeX or
MikTeX this is texmf/dvips/config/config.ps; with emTeX/TDS
additions should go into the "local" configuration file
texmf\dvips\config\dvips.ini (or ..\local\dvips.ini).

pdfTeX:
Make pdfTeX read the additional font map file uaq.map.  This
is usually accomplished by adding the line

map +uaq.map

to the pdfTeX configuration file.  With teTeX, fpTeX or
MikTeX this is texmf/pdftex/config/pdftex.cfg.

Notice that the above steps affect only dvips and pdfTeX.
As to other applications such as dvipdfm or the DVI viewer,
consult the documentation of your LaTeX system!


Updating the filename database
------------------------------
Many TeX systems require manual updating of a "filename
database" after adding of new files.  Please, consult the
documentation of your TeX system!


Using the URW Antiqua font with LaTeX
-------------------------------------
See the file antiqua.txt, which resides in the directory
texmf/doc/fonts/urw.
