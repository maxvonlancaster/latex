This is version 1.05 of mfpic. See README.txt for a list of files and a
brief description of each.

Generating and installing the files
-----------------------------------

This sections is unnecessary if you just get mfpic.tds.zip, copy it to
your local texmf directory , and unzip it there. You can find it on
CTAN: /install/generic/mfpic.tds.zip

-- Put mfpic.ins, mfpic.dtx and grafbase.dtx in the same temporary
   directory and change to that directory. Run latex (or tex) on
   mfpic.ins, which should produce the five files
      mfpic.tex
      mfpic.sty
      grafbase.mf
      grafbase.mp
      dvipsnam.mp

-- If you have an older version of mfpic, remove the old files with the
   same names as the above five from your TeX directories, or ensure
   that the following procedure overwrites them (back them up somewhere
   else first if you wish). Do the same for mfppatch.tex.

-- Copy mfpic.tex and mfppatch.tex where TeX and LaTeX will find it, and
   mfpic.sty where LaTeX will find it. On any TDS compliant system (such
   as teTeX, fpTeX, TeXLive, or MiKTeX) they can all be put in
     $TEXMF/tex/generic/mfpic/
   (where $TEXMF indicates a directory serving as a root of a texmf
   tree).

-- Copy grafbase.mp and dvipsnam.mp where MetaPost will find them, for
   example $TEXMF/metapost/mfpic/ .

-- Copy grafbase.mf where Metafont will find it. For example,
   $TEXMF/metafont/mfpic/ .

-- Copy mfpguide.pdf, mfpic-doc.pdf. mfpcard.pdf where documentation is
   kept. For example, $TEXMF/doc/generic/mfpic/ . Optionally, copy
   the .tex versions of these, plus mfpdoc.sty and coil.mps, as well as
   and examples/*.* either to the documentation area or to the same
   place as mfpic.tex. Also optional: copy the two .dtx files and
   mfpic.ins to the source area ($TEXMF/source/generic/mfpic/).

-- Some distributions might have a copy of the file grafbase.mf in the
   directory $TEXMF/fonts/public/mfpic. If so, delete it or replace it
   with a copy of the new one. If some package needs that particular
   version, put it someplace where mf and mpost will _not_ find it and
   arrange for that package to find it when necessary.

-- If required by your TeX system (MiKTeX, teTeX, MacTeX, and
   TeXLive all DO require it): !!UPDATE THE TeX FILENAME DATABASE!!

There is one optional step that may be useful (if you only wish to use
mfpic to produce MetaPost pictures, you may skip this): find the file
modes.mf on your system. Typically this will be in $TEXMF/metafont/misc/
Find near the end a line similar to

    localfont := ljfour;

Replace, if necessary, the string "ljfour" by one of the modes listed in
that file. At minimum, select one whose resolution (DPI) matches your
printer and/or the configuration of your dvi viewer. If you make such a
change, regenerate the mf.base file (fmtutil on teTeX or TeXLive;
MiKTeX Options in MiKTeX). On some systems this may be named plain.base.

Read mfpguide.pdf before trying anything further. If you are already
familiar with mfpic (version 0.2.10.9 or later) you can probably get
going right away.

If you want to read the documented source code for mfpic, run latex on
mfpic.dtx and grafbase.dtx (Peter Wilson's docmfp.sty is required
for grafbase.dtx) 2 or 3 times each. Then run makeindex for each:

    makeindex -s gind.ist -o mfpic.ind mfpic.idx
    makeindex -s gind.ist -o grafbase.ind grafbase.idx

and then latex again (once each).  The docmfp package can be found at
your favorite CTAN mirror. A copy of docmfp.sty is also on my web page
(see README). (Some TeX distributions (e.g., TeXLive) contain a rogue
copy of ltxdoc.cfg in the TeX input path (e.g., tex/latex/subfig), which
can mess up the indexes of these documents. Move it from the texinputs
area to the documentation area of your system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you desire to remake the mfpic manual (and why in the world would you
be wanting to do a daft thing like that?), make sure mfpic-doc.tex and
mfpdoc.sty are in the current directory or where LaTeX can find them.
Make sure that coil.mps is also where LaTeX can find it. Edit, if you
like, the paper size option in the \documentclass command in mfpic-doc.tex.
(The document uses Times for the main font family, LuxiMono for a
typewriter font, and CMSS for a sans serif font. Packages mathptmx amd
luximono are required.) Then run pdflatex three times:

    pdflatex mfpic-doc    (Hundreds of undefined labels messages)
    pdflatex mfpic-doc    (Labels have changed message)
    pdflatex mfpic-doc    (All resolved)

Now page numbers should be correct in the index, so run makeindex:

    makeindex -o mfpic-doc.ind mfpic-doc.idx

(or just "makeindex mfpic-doc" on many systems) then run latex two more
times:

    pdflatex mfpic-doc    (mfpic-doc.toc now has index added)
    pdflatex mfpic-doc    (Document toc now correct)

You can use latex instead of pdflatex, but you won't get clickable links
in the result. (I was too lazy to make that work.)

You could do something similar for mfpguide.tex (but that, too, would be
daft):

    pdflatex mfpguide    (produces guide.mp)
    mpost guide.mp       (creates guide.1, guide.2, etc.)
    pdflatex mfpguide    (includes figures, which changes pagination)
    pdflatex mfpguide    (All resolved)

This relies on mfpic so you should probably wait to do that until after
you are accustomed to that process. (And then take a cold shower until
this compulsion passes.)

And finally, if you forgot:
