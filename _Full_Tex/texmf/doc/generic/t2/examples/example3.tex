% This is the file example3.tex of the T2 package.

% If you need to process a Plain TeX file, you may use a LaTeX `plain'
% package by David Carlisle.  You can get it from
% CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/carlisle/plain.sty
% In this case, you do not need any hacks with plainenc.tex to typeset
% Cyrillic, and all the LaTeX power (including NFSS) is available. In
% particular, `babel' package works out of the box, as well as inputenc.

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[koi8-r]{inputenc}

\begin{document}

\begin{plain}

\input{file} % Input a Plain TeX file.
             % You may also type Plain TeX commands here
             % directly, without \input'ing any file.

\end{plain}
