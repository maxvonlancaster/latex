\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[T2A]{fontenc}
\usepackage[koi8-r]{inputenc}
\usepackage[russian]{babel}

% This is standard for Russian typesetting:
\usepackage{indentfirst}

% To get \texttrademark, \textregistered, \textcopyright, \quotesinglbase,
% \textbrokenbar and some other symbols looking good:
\usepackage{textcomp}

% Make \varkappa, \leqslant, \geqslant (and a lot of other) symbols
% available (they are used in Russian mathematical books instead of
% \kappa, \leq, \geq; also \varepsilon instead of \epsilon and
% \varphi instead of \phi are often used).
\usepackage{amssymb}

% If you are not using complex mathematical typesetting, comment out
% the line below.
\usepackage{amsmath}

% if you want straight integral signs (and other stuff)
\usepackage{euler}
