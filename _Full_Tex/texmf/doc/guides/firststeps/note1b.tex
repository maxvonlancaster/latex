It is of some concern to me   that 
the terminology used in  multi-section
 math courses is not uniform.

In several sections of the course on 
matrix theory, the strange term   
 ``hamiltonian-reduced'' is used. 
  I, personally, would rather call these ``hyper-simple.'' I
invite others to comment on this  problem.

Of special concern to me is the terminology in the course 
by Prof.~Hochschwabauer.
  Since his field is new, there is
 no accepted
terminology.   It is imperative 
that we arrive at a satisfactory solution.
