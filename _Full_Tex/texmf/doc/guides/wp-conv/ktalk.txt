We have two different products: Texport, which converts from LaTeX/TeX to
Word, and Publishing Companion, which converts from Word to LaTeX/TeX.
Equations (greek letters, math symbols, etc.) and text are converted, other
kinds of graphics not. When converting from  LaTeX to Word, equations are
converted 90-95% well. From Word -> LaTeX they came out only 60-70% because
Word equations format is encrypted.

Both Texport and Publishing run under Windows 3.x or Win'95, using Word 6.x
or later versions, on a IBM PC.  Each of these products work together with
our math editor, MathEdit, which let you create/edit/correct equations and
then save them in various graphics format: WMF (which is the best for Word),
BMP, TIFF, EPS and/or TeX/LaTeX code. In the conversion process, our macros
insert the equations graphics into the final document (when convert from
LaTeX to Word) or merge together the equations LaTeX code and the text (when
convert from Word to LaTeX).

For more information, please visit our web site at:

We have also a working demo of MathEdit which you can download. (This demo
permits you only equations not document conversion).
