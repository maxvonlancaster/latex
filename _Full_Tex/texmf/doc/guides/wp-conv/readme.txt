The html files in this directory (=folder) or zipfile
contain my FAQ list of
converters between LaTeX and PC Textprocessors in HTML format.

Because all html links between these pages are relative links,
the files can be put into any directory of your choice ("base dir");
but be sure to keep the directory structure,
i.e. there should be a subdir "bin" in the base dir.

Then start with the page "index.html".
