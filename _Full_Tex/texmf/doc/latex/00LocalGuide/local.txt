This is the

Local Guide to LaTeX for MiKTeX Users
=====================================

MiKTeX doesn't differ very much from any other TeX system you might
have used before.  Typesetting with MiKTeX involves these steps:

1. Start TeXworks and edit your LaTeX document.

2. Press Ctrl+T to create a typeset view of your document.

Please consult the MiKTeX manual for more information.  You should
find a shortcut to the manual in the Windows start menu. If not, visit
the MiKTeX project page (http://miktex.org) to read it on-line.

Thank you for using MiKTeX!
