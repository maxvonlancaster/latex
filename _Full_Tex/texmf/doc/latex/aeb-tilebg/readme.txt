Then aeb_tilebg Package

This newest package is a simple application of established packages
graphicx, multido and AeB Web. The package takes a rectangular
graphic and uses it to tile the background of the pages.

Download your favorite tiled background swatch from the Internet,
convert it to an .eps or a .pdf format (depending if you use
distiller---should work for users of Ghostscript as well---or
pdftex), place that image in the same folder as your source
document. Now, anywhere in your document, use the command
\setTileBgGraphic to create your tiled background.

Other features Turn tiling on or off. Draft mode (an package option)
used during the content development stage. Change the way the tiles
are laid out, change from top-to-bottom to bottom-to-top.

Installation Instructions: Unzip the distribution where your latex
installation looks for package files. Unzipping will create a create
a folder named aeb_tilebg, and the files will be deposited in this
folder. Don't forget to refresh you filename database, if you system
requires it.  Read the documentation in the doc folder, and view the
examples in the examples folder.
