AeB Pro Package

Applications to the DPS package (Das Puzzle Spiel).

DPS is a is a matching game. We have the list of questions and the
list of answers. The student matches the questions up with their
answers.

When you use AeB Pro, with the uselayers option, you can use layers
to make the matching puzzle more interesting to the student, and
enhances the ability of the author to pose longer questions.

Folder ex1: This folder contains two dps puzzle files,
    stat_math1.tex and stat_math1_g.tex. This is an extra credit
    document that I gave to my Elementary Statistics class in the
    Fall 2006.  They are the same questions and answers, but
    stat_math1_g.tex has more graphics than the other one.

    When a long question is chosen, the question appears in the
    central area of the puzzle. After the student correctly answers
    the question, the question is hidden again.

    The student is required to enter his/her name, they are
    instructed to print out and hand it the puzzle page.

Folder ex2: This folder contains two dps puzzle files,
    first_date.tex and first_date_g.tex.  Again, the questions and
    answers are the same, the only difference is the graphical
    content.

    A picture of a flower is sliced into two rows and three columns.
    Each tile is placed in a separate layer. As the user answers the
    questions, an additional tiles is made visible. Upon completion
    of the puzzle, the picture is fully visible.

    The photo of your choice can be sliced into rows and columns
    using the AeB Slicing batch sequence, Acrobat Pro 6.0 or later
    required.

One of the users has already made some splendid examples for his
students using the DPS package and AeB Pro. See the "Puzzle by
Holger Baier" at
