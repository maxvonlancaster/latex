                             ArabTeX Version 3
                             =================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Last changes: Version 3.11d, 23.10.2003
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The set of files, of which THIS file is supposed to be part of, 
	contains a package extending the capabilities of TeX/LaTeX to 
	generate the arabic writing from an ASCII transliteration for 
	texts in several languages using the arabic script. Several other 
	common encodings are also supported.

	The package is available in packed form as "arabtex.zip" and
	"arabtex.tgz". Depending on the server there may be also the 
	unpacked files; check for the latest version of "apatch.sty"!

	The following ASCII files give more detailed information:

	arabtex.doc  :    a short introduction (rather out of date)
	arabtex.faq  :    answers to some Frequently Asked Questions 
        	                  (updated as necessary)
	changes.txt  :    release history, new features, and known bugs
        	                  (updated as necessary)
	changes2.txt :    older release history up to version 3.00
	install.txt  :    list of available files, and installation notes
	apatch.sty   :    last minute corrections; put this file onto the
		      	  TEXINPUT path; it will patch automatically.
        			  (updated as necessary)

        There are also various additional documentation files.
	A subdirectory "REPORT", if still present, is OBSOLETE.

	There was a prototype, ArabTeX Version 1, which is now OBSOLETE.
        Version 2 was the first complete release accompanied by a manual,
	but is no more being maintained.

	Version 3 is an upward compatible extension of Version 2 with 
	many new features, e.g. the possibility to read input files in the 
	ASMO 449, ISO 8859-6, and UTF-8 Codes, and many new commands for 
	better formatting of Arabic text, or catering for historic writing 
	styles. Versions from 3.05 onward contain a package to process 
        Hebrew, and provide long right-to-left insertions. For details, 
	consult the manual and the ASCII file "readme.305".

	ArabTeX is copyrighted by the author. If you use the system for
	scientific work please give appropriate credit to the software
	and the author (e.g. in the colophon of a monograph.) We also
	appreciate a complimentary copy of any scientific work produced 
	with ArabTeX.

	ArabTeX may be redistributed and/or modified under the terms
   	of the LaTeX Project Public License distributed from CTAN
   	archives in the directory "macros/latex/base/lppl.txt"; either
   	version 1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

	ArabTeX is an experimental system and supposed to change without 
	prior notice. Whoever will use it does so at her/his/its own risk. 
	We cannot take any responsibility on correct function, suitability
	for whatever purpose, or correct documentation. 

	If you have any complaints or suggestions, please forward them to
	the author. We shall consider any reasonable suggestion, but we 
	will use our own judgment on any changes, and our resources are 
	severely limited. 

	If problems turn up while running ArabTeX, please check first at 
        "ftp.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de" whether there is a new version, 
	or whether there are any new corrections in "apatch.sty". If the 
        problem goes away with the new version, please inform the server 
        you got ArabTeX from; otherwise send a bug report to the author. 

	The reference site "ftp.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de" always holds
	the current version. We know that the CTAN servers "ftp.tex.ac.uk", 
	"ctan.tug.org", and "ftp.dante.de" mirror this site and update on
        a regular schedule.

	An empty E-Mail message to "arabtex@informatik.uni-stuttgart.de" 
        will produce a current status report.
