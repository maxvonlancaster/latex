``Historian'' implements a citation- and bibliography style for the biblatex system of programmable bibliographies and citations. It follows the guidelines of the Turabian Manual for Writers, which in turn is based on the Chicago Manual of Style.

This beta release already implements all the types of sources discussed by Turabian, with special emphasis on archival documents.

The package comprises the files historian.bbx, historian.cbx, and historian.lbx; also a User's Guide in the file historian.pdf (along with historian.tex, the LaTeX source file, where users can see the citation commands); and the BibTeX bibliography file, historian.bib, which contains all the examples used in the User's Guide.

Please send any bug reports or change requests to the e-mail address giving on the title page of the Demo and Guide.
