Confproc is a LaTeX2e package providing a new document-class together
with various tools (Perl and Unix/bash scripts) for building conference
proceedings, or concatenating any set of PDFs with a table of contents,
index, bookmarks and general bibliography. The LaTeX2e class is mainly
based on the 'pdfpages' package for PDF papers inclusion, and the
'hyperref' package for creating proper links, bookmarks and general
bibliography back references. It also uses many other packages for fine
tuning the table of contents, bibliography and index of authors.
The added value of this class is in the time saved to quickly design
conference proceedings or any collection of PDFs.

________________________________________________________________
New in version 0.7 (major update) - In short:
- key-value options for the class and \procpaper{} function
- tested with TeXLive 2008-2010
- can insert papers with any number of pages
- various new class options (hyperref, geometry, binding=Xmm, 
  checktitle, checkauthor, showmarginlines, showpapernumber,
  colorheaders=red, pdftk)
- documentation reorganized with more examples (incremental learning) 
- new 2-minute summary of commands and options (confproc-short.tex)
- new Unix/bash scripts: exportIndividualPDFs.sh, countnbpages.sh

________________________________________________________________
New in version 0.7 (major update) - In details:

- class:
  - class options: interface re-designed to make use of key-values 
    style ('kvoptions' package)
  - tested with TeXLive 2008, 2009 and 2010 (as of July 18th, 2010)
  - code clarified, using key-values ('keyval' package) and 
    \ifthenelse ('xifthen' package)

- PDF insertion: 
  - command \procpaper[]{} with 1 argument (file name) and 8 
    optional arguments replaces \cmdDescribe{\insertprocpaper} with 
    its 9 arguments. This re-design also makes use of key-values style 
    options (using keyval)
  - removed the limitation to a minimum of 2 pages and a maximum of 
    8 pages (now 1 to anything)

- class options:
  - hyperref/geometry: can now directly pass options to the 'hyperref' 
    and 'geometry' packages with the new hyperref={<option list>} and 
    geometry={<option list>} options
  - added 'papers=empty' option and mode. This offers a much faster 
    fake paper insertion, compared to 'papers='raft} ('draft' mode of 
    'pdfpages', but not checking if pages actually exist)
  - added new options for layout fine tuning and debug: 
    - 'binding=Xmm' to indicate the binding of the paperback version
    - 'checktitle' and 'checkauthor' to overlay the title and author 
      list onto the 1st page of each paper, for checking the 
      consistency of the table of contents with individual PDF papers
    - 'showmarginlines' to draw the margin lines (so that one can 
      match each page fits the template)
    - 'showpapernumber' to show the paper number below the page number
    - 'colorheaders=red' to color the header/footer
    - 'pdftk' to output commands for later setting PDF metadata of 
      individual PDFs
    - 'verbose' and 'debug' are now different options, and their 
      output texts have been clarified and now makes use of \PackageInfo 
      and \PackageWarning
  - options' default values: reset to simplify the most possible the 
    first tests

- documentation:
  - added a 2-minutes summary of commands and options (confproc-short.tex)
  - added a second (and simpler) example
  - improved & re-organized for incremental learning, and clarified 
    with margin notes and color code (using gray/black color code to 
    show differences between successive version of the code, and using 
    the 'colordoc' package for color code)

- scripts: added Unix/bash scripts for more functionalities, such as:
  - exportIndividualPDFs.sh: extracts individual paper with new page 
    numbers and proper metadata 
  - countnbpages.sh: counts number of pages in each individual PDF paper
