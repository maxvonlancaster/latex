File: ed-nfss.txt 19/7/94.  This is a plain ascii file.

        Please note that the following method of using EDMAC within
        LaTeX2e is still experimental.  Initial trials with real-life
        book preparation, however, seem to work well.

The New Font Selection Scheme (NFSS) is the normal font-handling scheme
used by LaTeX from version 2e (June 1994).  It is described in the book
"The LaTeX Companion" by Goossens, Mittelbach and Samarin
(Addison-Wesley, 1993), chapter 7.

To use this font scheme with EDMAC, you first need to install LaTeX2e.
After doing this, you should have a new format file called something
like "latex.fmt", which contains a dump of the LaTeX macros.  To use
this LaTeX2e format you might type a command like "tex &latex
<filename>" where <filename> is the name of the TeX input file you wish
to run through LaTeX2e.

To use EDMAC and NFSS together, you will do exactly the same as running
a normal LaTeX2e job, with the addition that you use the macro package
"edmacfss" (i.e., edmacfss.sty) and apart from the first couple of lines
of your EDMAC file, you treat your document as a standard EDMAC file.
That is to say, only EDMAC and Plain TeX commands will work, and not
LaTeX2e macros (except those required for NFSS).

[In fact, this is a white lie: you may have some limited luck using a
few other LaTeX2e commands, but this is rather hit-and-miss.  In
particular, EDMAC uses its own output routine, not LaTeX2e's, so lots
and lots of stuff specific to the LaTeX output routine (like float
placement) won't get executed.]

Here is a sample of what an EDMAC/NFSS input file might look like:

--------------------------------------
\documentclass[12pt]{article} % this starts LaTeX2e up properly, with big fonts.
\usepackage{adobegar}   % sets up LaTeX to use the Adobe Garamond font family.
\usepackage{edmacfss}   % this calls edmacfss.sty, which in turn calls edmac.doc

\begin{document}        % normal start of a LaTeX document

\firstlinenum=1         % EDMAC macros from here on...
\linenumincrement=1

\beginnumbering
\pstart
First \text{paragraph}\Afootnote{This is a test.}/. End of first
paragraph.
\pend

\pstart
\text{Second paragraph}\Bfootnote{So is this.}/. End of second
paragraph.
\pend
\endnumbering

\end{document}          % equally, you can say just \bye.

Many thanks to Wayne Sullivan for suggesting this approach to accessing
NFSS, and for providing the initial version of edmac.sty.
