 Typesetting text and math using Helvetica PostScript fonts
            
============================================================


The purpose of this macro package is to use MicroPress
HV-Math, version 1.2, as the main font family for text and
math.  HV-Math takes the common text fonts from Adobe
Helvetica and provides additional symbols and full math
alphabets, matching the Helvetica style.

The basic usage is simply to add \usepackage{hvmaths} to
your document preamble, however there are several options to
control the behaviour, as described in the documentation.


Prerequisites
=============
You need the HV-Math fonts, which are provided in Type1
(PostScript) format by MicroPress, Inc, see

  <http://www.micropress-inc.com/fonts/>.  
  
A free bitmapped (demo) version is also available from CTAN:

  fonts/micropress/hvmath/
  
* Note that the current version of the hvmaths package
* requires a recent distribution of the HV-Math fonts, which
* includes the AMS symbols.


Installing the macro package
============================
The documented source of the package is the file
hvmaths.dtx.

To generate the package file you should run

  latex hvmaths.ins

The resulting .sty and .fd files must then be moved to a
directory where LaTeX will find them.  

To generate the package documentation you should run

  latex hvmaths.dtx
