The National Research Council (NRC) Research Press provides the
following class files for the benefit of its authors:

   nrc1.cls is for single-column layouts
   nrc2.cls is for double-column journal layouts

These are generated via the nrc.ins + nrc.dtx files. See the README
file for details. The userguide is also available and should be
downloaded in an appropriate format. 


      AUTHORS ARE STRONGLY ADVISED TO REPLACE THEIR FORMER
        VERSIONS OF THE CLASS FILES WITH THESE NEW ONES. 

    THE NEW USERGUIDE SHOULD ALSO BE DOWNLOADED AND PRINTED. 


The latest versions of all files have a great number of improvements
and enhancements over the previous versions.

Old version of nrc.dtx: 2000/07/26 v1.3j.7c
New version of nrc.dtx: 2002/11/19 v2.0

Old version of nrc.ins: 2000/10/02
New version of nrc.ins: 2002/11/19

Old version of userguide: 21 NOV 2000
New version of userguide: 18 NOV 2002

======================================================================

   This note (AUTHORS.txt) focusses on author-specific elements
   in the userguide, and avoid common pitfalls.


1. UPDATING AND GENERATING NEW CLASS FILES

   Use the README file to generate the necessary class files and
   instructions on where they should be stored on your machine. 

   Check CTAN periodically for updates in the directory:

      tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/nrc


2. DOCUMENTATION
  
   The Userguide has two main components: information on creating and
   coding a file (sections 1 through 5), and additional information
   for in-house staff (from section 6 to the end). 


3. CLASS OPTIONS

   There are no new options. However, there is a simplification of
   options for authors.

   The publicly available class files automatically activate
   author-specific codes, and de-activate in-house codes (the log file
   will provide information/warnings if the latter are accessed). It
   is no longer necessary to explicitly insert author-specific codes
   such as

                genTeX     usecmfonts     type1rest

   See section 2.1 for details.


4. ADDITIONAL PACKAGES

   Experience has shown that the following packages (all available
   from CTAN) are consistently used and provide the additional
   functionality authors (and the NRC Research Press) most often
   require:

      graphicx     rotating      
      amsmath      amssymb     bm
      cite         babel

   As well, tables benefit from the additional options available in
   the array package. 


   Any other packages which authors find helpful MUST accompany their
   submissions. This is particularly important where submissions are
   using old versions of packages --- production staff only have
   access to new versions on CTAN; should they have to acquire the
   additional (and latest) packages themselves, these may not always
   work in the same way as an older version. Of course, authors are
   encouraged to use current versions of all additional packages. 


   Additional author-specific macros should be gathered together in
   the preamble area, after all other packages have been loaded. See
   section 3.2 for details.
