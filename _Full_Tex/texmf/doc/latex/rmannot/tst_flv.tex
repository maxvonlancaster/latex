Video using \texttt{skin3} and poster style that Acrobat uses.

Here is the same video in a floating window, with \texttt{skin2}.

This demo file size is 507KB. The size of the \texttt{horse1.flv}
movie is 391KB, the size of \texttt{movie\_poster} is 192KB, and the
size of \texttt{horse1\_poster} is 202KB; the sum of these three
file sizes is 785KB. Acrobat does do some file compression, so the final
file size is smaller than the sum of the movie and graphic files
that it contains. But wait, the FLV file was used three times in
three different rich media annotations, and \texttt{horse1\_poster}
was used twice.  If the rich media annotations were created by
Acrobat's user interface, Acrobat would have embedded the FLV file
three times and embedded the \texttt{horse1\_poster} twice, swelling
the file size to 1.49MB! The \texttt{rmannot} package, however, only
embeds each of these files once, and uses and re-uses them as
needed.
