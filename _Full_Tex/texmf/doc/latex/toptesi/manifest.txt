di Torino), Bari, Lausanne and Grenoble, of the Universities of Trieste,
Torino,  Bologna, Bari, Bergamo, Brescia, Genova, Palermo, Padova,
Pisa, Piemonte Orientale, Roma-1, Roma-2, Roma-3, Salerno, and

any prominent or subtle limitations in the use of their logo. The
fraudulent or improper use of these logos is in the complete
responsibility of the user.

The file

    toptesi-example.tex

is an example of the usage of this work; it may be used as a template,
but in itself it is not part of this Work

The file toptesi-example.xmpdata is an example of the contents and format of the metadata that must be included into the same directatory as the thesis main file in order to be able to use pdflatex for typesetting a file that hopefully is PDF/A-1b compliant, that is in the "weak" archivable PDF format.
