\maketitle

\begin{abstract}\noindent
This package was developed as a typographers toolbox offering the most important features for
everyday work. First it allows setting the paper size as well as the page layout. The next
important feature is the ability of printing crop marks both with \TeX~+~dvips or (x)dvipdfm(x) and with pdf\TeX.
Finally it is possible to reflect pages both horizontally and vertically.
\end{abstract}

\tableofcontents

\section{Introduction}
Users will probably ask: ``Why another page layout package? Is not \pkg{geometry} all what we
need?'' The answer to this question is not easy. The \pkg{geometry} package provides a lot of
features, maybe even too many features. However, some features are missing. Packages for crop marks
can also be found but correct positioning of the crop marks requires cooperation with the
page layout package. It is therefore natural to integrate both these functions into a single
package.

The package is useful also for preparation of book covers. It places the marks showing the position
of a spine and optionally flaps. If you want to see whether the spine and the front and back cover
contents are properly aligned, you can display the frames. Moreover, it is often necessary to
create a proof of the cover while the book is not yet finished and the thickness of the spine is
not known and can be only approximated. You can thus leave the paper width empty and the package
will calculate it from the page width, the flap width and the spine thickness. Whenever the final
value of the spine thickness is known, you change it in the list of options and the whole layout
will adapt automatically.

The package is a result of a long-term development inspired by author's everyday needs. It is a
collection of macros that were manually copied from document to document, later placed into private
packages and finally it matured into a package prepared for general use.

Being a result of development it may happen that you may be in the same situation in which I was
myself. The book was finished and the last task was to add the crop marks. Removing layout
definition from a document and replacing it with a different package may cause errors and one more
proof-reading is time consuming and expensive. This package therefore allows the page layout logic
to be switched off and just add the crop marks provided the paper dimensions are correctly
supplied. The details will be explained later when describing the package options.

\section{Usage}
The package is loaded simply by:

\vb
\verb;\usepackage[;$\langle$options$\rangle$\verb;]{zwpagelayout};

\vb
Remember that the options cannot be given later, all of them must be present either here or as
options to the \cmd{documentclass} command. The package will set some dimensions based upon
\cmd{normalsize}. The package that modifies font sizes must therefore be loaded before
\pkg{zwpagelayout}.

\section{Option values}

Some options accept a value. If the option is not specified, it may have a \textbf{default} value. For ease of use an
option may be given without a value. It will then have a \textbf{standard} value. The default and standard
values will be given in the option description.

\section{Paper size and orientation}
The first task of the package is to define paper size and orientation. Remember that the package is
intended for use in real life where we cannot be limitted to standard papers sizes. However, the
standard paper sizes are used quite often and we must be able to use them too. The options were
tested with pdf\TeX, \pkg{dvips} as well as \pkg{(x)dvipdfm(x)}.

\subsection{Orientation}\label{orientation}
\omg{AllowWidthHeightSwitching}
The package usually accepts the dimentsions as they are, \ie. width and height of the page. The
orientation cannot be changed. If you wish to have the possibility to change the orientation, you
have to use this option. It is used automatically with all standard paper sizes (see
section~\ref{standard}). You will rarely specify it yourself.

\omg{Portrait}\omg{Landscape}
These options sets the paper orientation, \opt{Portrait} is the default. They can be used only if
\opt{AllowWidthHeightSwitching} was specified, otherwise they are ignored.

\subsection{Paper size}
The package option defines the trimmed paper size. If the crop marks are added, the real paper size
will be added. Dimensions \cmd{paperwidth} and \cmd{paperheight} will thus contain the values that
will subsequently be sent to the driver. If you for any reason wish to know the trimmed dimensions,
you can calculate them as follows:

\begin{center}
trimmed width = \cmd{paperwidth} -- 2\cmd{hoffset}

trimmed height = \cmd{paperheight} -- 2\cmd{voffset}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Generic paper size}
\omg{papersize}
Option \opt{papersize} is used to define arbitrary paper size. You define it as a pair of two
dimensions, the width and the height. The numbers are separated by a comma, therefore the
specification must be enclosed within braces, \eg.

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[papersize={200mm,100mm}]{zwpagelayout}
\end{verbatim}

The above written command sets the paper width to 200\,mm and the paper height to 100\,mm, \ie. the
paper orientation will be landscape. Now consider the following:

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[papersize={200mm,100mm},
    AllowWidthHeightSwitching]{zwpagelayout}
\end{verbatim}

Since the width/height switching is allowed and the default orientation is portrait (option
\opt{Portrait} is the default), the width will be 100\,mm and the height will be 200\,mm.

You can achieve the same result as the first command by the lengthy code:

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[papersize={200mm,100mm},
    AllowWidthHeightSwitching,Landscape]{zwpagelayout}
\end{verbatim}

You see that the command may become confusing. You should better not use
\opt{AllowWidthHeightSwitching} together with \opt{papersize}.

If the \opt{papersize} option is not used, it defaults to the A4 size, \ie. to paper dimensions \papdims[\krat]{a4}.

If the book cover is being typeset, we want to calculate at least the width. The detailed
explanation will be given in section~\ref{missing}. Here we put just as an example:

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[papersize={,200mm},spine=15mm,textwidth=14cm,
            margins]{zwpagelayout}
\end{verbatim}

It is even possible to calculate both dimensions using \eg.

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[papersize,spine=15mm,textwidth=14cm,textheight=20cm,
            margins]{zwpagelayout}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Standard paper sizes}\label{standard}
\omg{a0\,\ldots}\omg{\ldots\,c10}\omg{executive}\omg{legal}\omg{letter}
Options \opt{a0}\ldots\opt{a10}, \opt{b0}\ldots\opt{b10}, \opt{c0}\ldots\opt{c10} are used to
select paper size according to the A, B or C series where the dimensions are rounded to integers in
milimeters. For instance, the A6 size is \papdims[\krat]{a6}. The package also supports paper sizes
\opt{executive} (\papdims[\krat]{executive}), \opt{legal} (\papdims[\krat]{legal}), and
\opt{letter} (\papdims[\krat]{letter}). If one of these options is used,
\opt{AllowWidthHeightSwitching} and \opt{Portrait} are assumed. The page orientation may be
switched by option \opt{Landscape} (see section~\ref{orientation}).

\section{Page layout options}
These options define the layout of the odd page. The layout of the even page is assumed to be a mirror image.
The values of \cmd{oddsidemargin} and \cmd{evensidemargin} are calculated from the values of the options.

\subsection{Margins}
This set of options us used to define margin sizes.
Remember that all margins are measured from the top left corner of the paper, not from 1in border which is
the \textsc{dvi} origin!

\subsubsection{Option \opt{margins}, standard 0\,mm}
\omg{margins}
This option sets all margins (top, left, right, bottom) to the specified size. You will not be able to change
some of the margin to another size. If you need different size for any margin, you have to set all of them
separately and not use this option. Notice that almost everything may be calculated automatically, thus it is
not necessary to specify all values.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{topmargin}, default 1\,in}
\omg{topmargin}
This option sets the value of \cmd{topmargin}.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{botmargin}, standard \opt{topmargin}}
\omg{botmargin}
This option specifies the size of the margin below the running footer.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{leftmargin}, default --1\,in}
\omg{leftmargin}
This option sets the value of the margin at the left side of an odd page (and the margin at the right side of
an even page). Negative value means that the value was not given.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{rightmargin}, default --1\,in}
\omg{rightmargin}
This is the size of the right side of an odd page. Similarly the negative value means that the option was not
specified.

\subsection{Text dimensions}
The following options are used to specify the height and width of the text.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{textwidth}, default --1\,in}
\omg{textwidth}
This option specifies the width of the text without marginal notes. Its meaning is different for
book covers. The option specifies the width of the cover without the extra spine (\opt{xsipne}),
flap (\opt{flap}) and trimming (\opt{xtrim} or \opt{trim}).

\subsubsection{Option \opt{textheight}, default --1\,in}
\omg{textheight}
This option specifies the total height of the text including the header and footer.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{headheight}, default 0\,mm}
\omg{headheight}
This option specifies the height of the running head.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{headsep}, default 0\,mm}
\omg{headsep}
This is the value of \cmd{headsep}.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{footskip}, default 0\,mm}
\omg{footskip}
This option specifies the value of \cmd{footskip}.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{topskip}\texorpdfstring{, default \cmd{topskip}}{}}
\omg{topskip}
This option enables changing the value of \cmd{topskip}. It is rarely needed. However, the value of
\cmd{topskip} is usually less than \cmd{baselineskip} which may cause problems in some page layout schemes.
Since we have already written that font sizes must be defined before \pkg{zwpagelayout} is loaded, you can
safely specify \verb;topskip=\baselineskip;.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{strictheight}, default \false, standard \true}
\omg{strictheight}
The value of the \LaTeX\ dimension \cmd{textheight} is calculated from the values of the options and later
adjusted so that together with \cmd{topskip} it represents an integer number of lines. This may not be
desirable in some cases. This option instructs the package not to perform any adjustment and accept the
calculated value.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{adjustfootskip}, default \true, standard \true}
\omg{adjustfootskip}
If option \opt{strictheight} is not given, the calculated value of \cmd{textheight} is decreased to the nearest
integer multiple of \cmd{baselineskip}. The difference is then added to \cmd{footskip} in order to preserve to
total height. If \opt{adjustfootskip} is set to \false, the difference is added to \cmd{headsep} instead.

\includegraphics{adjusthead}

\medskip
\caption{Compensation of \cmd{textheight} by changing \cmd{footskip} (on the left) and
\cmd{headsep} (on the right)}\label{adj}
\end{figure}

The difference betweem these two options is shown in figure~\ref{adj}. Adjustment of \cmd{footskip}
was achieved by:

\medskip
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[c8,margins=6mm,headheight=4mm,headsep=4mm,
   croplength=3mm,cropgap=2mm,
   cropmarks,cropframe,croptitle=Adjust\ footskip]{zwpagelayout}
\end{verbatim}

\medskip \noindent
The sample on te right side of the figure was created by:

\medskip
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[c8,margins=6mm,headheight=4mm,headsep=4mm,adjustheadsep,
   croplength=3mm,cropgap=2mm,
   cropmarks,cropframe,croptitle=Adjust\ headsep]{zwpagelayout}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Option \opt{adjustheadsep}, default \true, standard \true}
\omg{adjustheadsep}
This is a complementary option to \opt{adjustfootskip}.

\section{Crop marks}\label{cropmarks}
The crop marks must appear outside the print area. The package assumes that \cmd{paperheight} and
\cmd{paperwidth} contain the page size after trimming. These dimensions will then be increased and the page
will be shifted by setting \cmd{hoffset} and \cmd{voffset}. If you wish to print the crop marks using
\opt{zwpagelayout}, you must not change values of \cmd{hoffset} and \cmd{voffset}.

The values of \cmd{hoffset} and \cmd{voffset} will be set to the sum of \opt{croplength} and \opt{cropgap}, see the following
text.

\subsection{Basic crop marks options}
Options described in this section define basic behaviour of the crop marks.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{onlycropmarks}, default \false, standard \true}
\omg{onlycropmarks}
It may happen that a document is already finished and proof-read and just the crop marks have to be added.
By specifying option \opt{onlycropmarks} you instruct the package to ignore all page layout options and
interpret the crop marks options only. You just have to ensure that \cmd{paperheight} and \cmd{paperwidth} are
set to the dimensions of the trimmed page before the \pkg{zwpagelayout} package is loaded and \cmd{hoffset} and
\cmd{voffset} are left at their default values.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{cropmarks}, default \false, standard \true}
\omg{cropmarks}
This option asks for creation of the crop marks.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{nocropmarks}, default \true, standard \true}
\omg{nocropmarks}
This is a complementary option to \opt{cropmarks}.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{croplength}, default 5\,mm}
\omg{croplength}
This option specifies the length of the crop mark.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{cropgap}, default 5\,mm}
\omg{cropgap}
This is the space that must be left blank between the crop marks and the trimmed page.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{spine}}
\omg{spine}
This option is used for designing book covers. It specifies the width of the book spine. You can
even request a zero width but negative values will have disastrous results.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{xspine}}
\omg{xspine}
This option defines the extra space adjacent to the spine so that the book can be safely opened.
This space should not be used for printing logos etc., because they will soon be damaged by
frequent use of the book. The option is ignored unless \opt{spine} is used.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{flap}}
\omg{flap}
This is another option for book covers. It specifies the width of the flap. If \opt{spine} is
given, the book cover is supposed to have flaps of equal sizes on both sides. Sometimes you do not
have flaps and the back cover remains empty, thus you do not like to prepare the design of it, you
just wish to design the spine and the front cover. This can be acheved by specifying \opt{flap} as
the spine thickness and omitting \opt{spine}.

\subsubsection{Options \opt{trim}, \opt{xtrim}, \opt{ytrim}}
\omg{trim}\omg{xtrim}\omg{ytrim}
The paper or canvas used for printing the book covers is folded to the inner side yet part of it
will be visible. Such part is specified by \opt{xtrim} in horizontal direction and \opt{ytrim} in
vertical direction. You can use \opt{trim} to set both of them to the same value.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{cropframe}, default \false, standard \true}
\omg{cropframe}
When designing a book cover we often wish to verify whether all elements are properly aligned.
Option \opt{cropframe} can be used to print the frames. It is active only if \opt{cropmarks} was
specified.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{nocropframe}, default \true, standard \true}
\omg{nocropframe}
This is a complementary option to \opt{cropframe}.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{cropstyle}}\label{cropstyle}
\omg{cropstyle}
This option selects the style of the crop marks. Currently only the \textit{default} style is
defined, thus the option is only useful if you write your own extension.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{croptitle}}
\omg{croptitle}
This option defines the text that should be printed on each page. It may \eg. be the title of the
document. Remember that all spaces are gobbled when parsing the options. The spaces must therefore
be specified as \verb*;\ ;.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{cropseparator}}
\omg{cropseparator}
This is the separator between the title and the page number. Its default value is \verb;:\quad;.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{pagenumberfirst}, default \false, standard \true}
\omg{pagenumberfirst}
Each page contains the title followed by the separator and the page number. If you set this
option to \true, the order will be reversed.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{pagenumberlast}, default \true, standard \true}
\omg{pagenumberlast}
This is a complementary option to \opt{pagenumberfirst}.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{usepagenumbers}, default \true, standard \true}
\omg{usepagenumbers}
This option requests printing the page numbers.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{nopagenumbers}, default \false, standard \true}
\omg{nopagenumbers}
This is a complementary option to \opt{usepagenumbers}.

\iffalse
\subsubsection{Option \opt{cropfontsize}}
\omg{cropfontsize}
This option defines the font size command issued just before the title and page number are printed.
The default command is \verb;\fontsize{10}{10};.

\subsubsection{Option \opt{cropfont}}
\omg{cropfont}
This option contains the command to select a font for the title and the page number. The default
command is \cmd{normalfont}.
\fi

\subsubsection{Option \opt{nobleedclip}, default \false, standard \true}
\omg{nobleedclip}
The pages are clipped to the bleed box so that graphics does not collide with the crop marks. Since
the package must work also with \pkg{dvips}, the PDF operators are not used and the crop marks area
outside the bleed box is just overpainted with white rectangles. The \pkg{color} package is thus
required and will be loaded automatically. If you set \opt{nobleedclip} to \true, the pages will
not be clipped. It may be useful if you know that nothing extends to the crop marks area and the
\pkg{color} package may clash with other packages required by your document.


\subsection{Color support for crop marks}
The package is able to produce basic color support, namely it prints the names of separations. The
color support is implemented via a few options. Color printing is performed using the \pkg{color}
package that is loaded automatically. The package does not use predefined color names.

\omg{color}
Option \opt{color} asks for the color support. Without setting this option to \true\ all other
color options are silently ignored.

\omg{colormodel}
Option \opt{colormodel} defines the color model used. Its default value is \texttt{cmyk}. You will
rarely need to change it.

\omg{cropcolor}
Option \opt{cropcolor} specifies the color to be used for the crop marks. Remember that the crop
marks must be visible on all separations, thus it might not be sufficient to print them in black.
As default their color is mixed of 100\,\% of all components of the current color model. Since the
default model is \texttt{cmyk}, the default value of this option is \verb;{1,1,1,1};. Notice that the
syntax conforms to the requirements of the \pkg{color} package.

\omg{colors}
Option \opt{colors} assigns names to the color components of the current model. Specification of
each color must be enclosed in curly brackets. The color name is followed by a colon and comma
separated values conforming to the syntax of the \pkg{color} package. It will be clear from the
following examples.

Suppose that for some strange reason you prepare the document in the RGB space. Your specification
will then be:

\medskip

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[cropmarks,color,colormodel=rgb,cropcolor={1,1,1},
    colors={{RED:1,0,0},{GREEN:0,1,0},{BLUE:0,0,1}},
    croptitle=RGB\ example]{zwpagelayout}
\end{verbatim}

\medskip

Now we show a more realistic example. The document should be printed in custom colors. Since the
true specification of custom colors requires much work and is rarely worth the trouble, we make use
of the CMYK model. We will use cyan instead of Pantone 298 (blue), magenta instead of Pantone 213
(red), black will remain black and the yellow separation will be unused. The crop marks should not
produce anything on the yellow separation and we should provide proper color names. The
specification will therefore look as:

\medskip

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[cropmarks,color,cropcolor={1,1,0,1},
    colors={{Pantone\ 298\ (blue):1,0,0,0},
            {Pantone\ 213\ (red):0,1,0,0},{Black:0,0,0,1}},
    croptitle=Example\ with\ custom\ colors]{zwpagelayout}
\end{verbatim}

\medskip

Notice that the \opt{colormodel} option was not specified. Its default value was used. The
\opt{cropcolor} option left zero for the yellow separation.

\section{Calculation of missing dimensions}\label{missing}
The package can either calculate paper size from the page layout dimensions or calculate missing
page layout dimensions if the paper size and some dimensions are known. It operates separately for
the height and width. You can \eg. define the paper height and calculate the text height from it
and the margins but specify all width layout dimensions and calculate the paper width.

When designing simple pages it is better to define the paper size and calculate some page layout
dimensions. However, for bok covers it is recommended to calculate at least the paper width from
the layout dimensions of the front cover, the spine and the flap width.

\subsection{Calculation of the paper size}
Remember that paper size can be calculated only if all page layout dimensions for the corresponding
orientation (height, width) are specified. There is no diagnostics for warning you if some
important options are missing, the resukt will just be wrong or the package may even report an
error. All dimensions are considered \emph{without} the area for the crop marks.

\subsubsection{Paper height}
Calculation of the paper height is very simple. The formula is:

\medskip
\cmd{paperheight} = \opt{topmargin} + \opt{textheight} + \opt{botmargin} + 2 \opt{ytrim}

\medskip \noindent
Remember that \opt{textheight} includes also \cmd{headheight}, \cmd{headsep}, and \cmd{footskip}.
It is not necessary to specify \opt{ytrim}, the package checks the existence of this option and
removes it from the formula if not given.

\subsubsection{Paper width}
Algorithm for calculating the paper width differs for simple pages and book covers. In the simple
case the paper width is calculated as follows:

\medskip
\cmd{paperwidth} = \opt{leftmargin} + \opt{textwidth} + \opt{rightmargin}

\medskip \noindent
The value of \cmd{textwidth} will be equal to \opt{textwidth}. The same value will be stored in
macro \cmd{UserWidth}, see section~\ref{crop.macros}.

If the book cover is designed, the \opt{textwidth} option refers to the width of the text at the
front cover but \opt{leftmargin} and \opt{rightmargin} are used to set \cmd{oddsidemargin} and
\cmd{evensidemargin}. It is therefore better to set these options to zero, or alternatively to the
same value as \opt{flap} or \opt{xtrim} if the corresponding area will be left empty. The value of
\cmd{textwidth} will then be calculated from the final paper width by:

\medskip
\cmd{textwidth} = \cmd{paperwidth} -- \opt{leftmargin} -- \opt{rightmargin}

\medskip
If the \opt{flap} option is used without the \opt{spine} option in order to emulate the front cover
and spine with an empty back cover, the paper width is calculated as:

\medskip
\cmd{paperwidth} = \opt{leftmargin} + \opt{flap} + \opt{textwidth} + \opt{xtrim} +
\opt{rightmargin}

\medskip \noindent
The value of \opt{xtrim} may be omitted. The value of \opt{xspine} will be silently ignored. It is
not allowed to have just the spine, the front cover and the flap while leaqving the back cover
empty.

The case of a book cover with the spine given is a bit more complicated:

\medskip
\textit{width} = \opt{xspine} + \opt{textwidth} + \opt{flap} + \opt{xtrim}

\cmd{paperwidth} = \opt{leftmargin} + \opt{spine} + 2 \textit{width} + \opt{rightmargin}

\medskip \noindent
Options \opt{xspine}, \opt{flap}, and \opt{xtrim} need not be specified if these elements are not
needed.

\subsection{Calculation of page layout dimensions}\label{calc.pg.layout}
Algorithm for calculating the page layout dimensions is intended for simple pages, not for book
covers. Options \opt{xtrim}, \opt{ytrim}, \opt{spine}, \opt{xspine}, and \opt{flap} are silently
ignored but will be taken into account when producing the crop marks. You can still make use of
this algorithm if you understand what you are doing and if you wish to do extra calculations
yourself.

The dimensions may be overdetermined. In such a case the algorithm disregards one of the dimensions
and calculates it.

\subsubsection{Vertical dimensions}\label{vert.dim}
The algorithm first looks whether \opt{textheight} was given. If not it is assumed that the user
wishes to have it calculated from the paper height and the margins. If the \opt{botmargin} option was
not set, it will be set to the same valu as \opt{topmargin}.

In the second step the package looks whether \opt{botmargin} is defined, either by the user or from
the previous step. If so, the text height is calculated, otherwise the bottom margin is calculated
from the top margin and the text height. As a matter of fact, the bottom margin is never used by
\TeX.

Finally the value of \cmd{textwidth} is reduced by \cmd{headheight}, \cmd{headsep}, and
\cmd{footskip}. If \opt{strictheight} is \cmd{false}, the values are later adjusted according to
options \opt{adjustfootskip} and \opt{adjustheadsep} so that \cmd{textheight} -- \cmd{topskip} is
an integer multiple of \cmd{baselineskip}.

\subsubsection{Horizontal dimensions}
The sum of the horizontal dimensions must be equal to the paper width according to the relation:

\medskip
\opt{leftmargin} + \opt{textwidth} + \opt{rightmargin} = \cmd{paperwidth}

\medskip \noindent
If all three dimensions are specified, \opt{textwidth} is disregarded and calculated from the other
dimensions. If any two dimensions are given, the missing one is calculated from the above formula.
If only one dimension is given, it is assumed that both margins have the same size and the above
formula is applied. It is even possible to omit all dimensions. In such a case the margins are
assumed to have the same size as \opt{topmargin} and the text width can thus be calculated.

\section{Page reflection}
\omg{Reflect\-Horizontally}
\omg{ReflectVertically}
We sometimes need to print the whole document as a mirror image. Although there are external tools
that can provide such a job taking PDF or PS as input, it is useful to do everything in a single
step. The package provides options \opt{ReflectHorizontally} for horizontal reflection and
\opt{ReflectVertically} for vertical reflection, respectively. If you specify both, some drivers
may interpret both of them and print rotated 180$^{\circ}$, some interpret only one of them and
some driver may get totally confused. Remember that these options are intended for printing only.
The hypertext links made by the \pkg{hyperref} package will be wrong. If you wish to rotate parts
of texts and preserve hyperlinks, use \pkg{rotating} instead.

\section{Useful macros}\label{macros}
The package offers two types of useful macros. The macros from the first group help in designing
the document. However, as mentioned in the Introduction, the package may be deployed in already
existing document just for adding the crop marks. In order to reduce the risk of conflicts with
other packages these macros are unavailable if the \opt{onlycropmarks} option is used. The second
group contains macros that are primarily used in the crop mark generation. They are always visible.

\subsection{Userspace macros}\label{user.macros}
As written above, macros of this group are available only if the \opt{onlycropmarks} option was not
used. It is not planned to make any interface for providing them even with the \opt{onlycropmarks}
option. If the document is already finished, you do not need them. If you write a new document, it
is preferable to use the whole package for defining the page layout. The macros will than be
available.

\cmg{topskip}
\cmg{Vcorr}
\TeX\ should use integer arithmetic but some implementations, \eg. em\TeX, violate this rule. This
makes processing the text faster but may have bad results. If you combine text with boxes and fixed
size glues the height of which is an integer multiple of \cmd{baselineskip}, the round-off errors
may add a few scaled points, the page overflows and as a result is made one line shorter and
underfull vbox is reported. For this reason tiny shrink is added to \cmd{topskip}, its
size is \the\topskip. Yet it may not be sufficient in some cases. We therefore provide vertical
skip macro \cmd{Vcorr} the size of which is shrinkable zero. The meaning of \cmd{Vcorr} is {\tt
\meaning\Vcorr}.

\cmg{vb}
We often need a vertical skip the size of which is a multiple of \cmd{baselineskip}. Macro \cmd{vb}
serves this very purpose. It accepts an optional argument in square brackets which denotes the
multiple of \cmd{baselineskip}. The default value is~1. The command also contains compensation
shrinkage. Some packages activate several characters, even those which could be used in numerical
and dimension specifications. Hyphens and dots are temporarily deactivated within the optional
argument of the \cmd{vb} macro. You thus can comfortably specify negative as well as fractional
dimensions.

\cmg{NewOddPage}
\LaTeX\ provides \cmd{cleardoublepage} for moving the next text to the beginning of the odd page.
However, you have no control over the page style of the inserted empty even page. This feature is
enabled in the \cmd{NewOddPage} macro. Its syntax is:

\medskip
\verb;\NewOddPage*[;$\langle$style$\rangle$\verb;];

\medskip\noindent
Optional parameter $\langle$style$\rangle$ defines the style of the empty even page that should be
fed to the \cmd{thispagestyle} command. The default is \texttt{empty}. The starred version displays
a warning in the log file if an empty page was inserted.

\cmg{SetOddPageMessage}
This macro sets the contents of the message that should be displayed as a warning if an empty page
was inserted as a result of \cmd{NewOddPage*}. The macro acts as \cmd{gdef}. This means that the
definition is global and you can therefore have only one message unless you redefine it. The body
of the message may contain macros. They will be expanded when the message is being written. You can
use \cmd{MessageBreak} in order to split the text into several lines.

\cmg{NewEvenPage}
Generally speaking, you should not start a chapter on an even page but there are cases when it is
desirable. Imagine the situation when each chapter starts with a full page illustration on the left
and with its title page on the right. In such cases you need to start at the even page but \LaTeX\
does not contain any direct tool for doing it. This package provides the \cmd{NewEvenPage} with the
same syntaxe as \cmd{NewOddPage}.

\cmg{SetEvenPageMessage}
Similarly this macro serves for setting the message text that appears if an empty page was inserted
as a result of the \cmd{NewEvenPage*} macro.

\subsection{Crop mark macros}\label{crop.macros}
\cmg{clap}
\TeX\ offers zero-width horizontal boxes with contents overlapping to the right (\cmd{rlap}) or to
the left (\cmd{llap}). The \pkg{zwpagelayout} package frequently needs a zero-width box with the
contents centered overlapping evenly to both sides. The package thus provides macro \cmd{clap} and
makes it available for the user.

\cmg{CropFlap}
\cmg{CropSpine}
\cmg{CropXSpine}
\cmg{CropXtrim}
\cmg{CropYtrim}
\cmg{UserWidth}
\cmg{UserLeftMargin}
\cmg{UserRightMargin}
It was written in the Introduction that the package allows to prepare the book cover before the
exact dimensions are known. Later we just adapt the values of the package options and everything is
recalculated automatically. As a matter of fact, it could not happen if we did not refer to
selected dimensions in the document symbolically. Thus the values of some options are available in
macros: \cmd{CropFlap}\is\opt{flap}, \cmd{CropSpine}\is\opt{spine}, \cmd{CropXSpine}\is\opt{spine},
\cmd{CropXtrim}\is\opt{xtrim}, \cmd{CropYtrim}\is\opt{ytrim},
\cmd{UserWidth}\is\opt{textwidth}, \cmd{UserLeftMargin}\is\opt{leftmargin},
\cmd{UserRightMargin}\is\opt{rightmargin}.

The use of these macros can be shown by an example. The book cover with flaps displayed in
Figure~\ref{cover} was prepared by the following code:

\medskip
\verbatiminput{coversample}

\begin{sidewaysfigure}[p]
\centerline{\includegraphics{coversample}}

\caption{Sample of a book cover with flaps}\label{cover}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

Remember that these macros contain only the dimensions that were specified in the \cmd{usepackage}
command, not those that were calculated by the algorithm described in section~\ref{calc.pg.layout}.
If a shortcut option was used, all real dimensions are defined, \ie. the \opt{margins} option fills
all four margin options, \opt{topmargin}, \opt{leftmargin}, \opt{rightmargin}, \opt{botmargin}, and
the \opt{trim} option fills both \opt{xtrim} and \opt{ytrim}. You can take advantage of it to make
your document more general. You can \eg. define the book cover in two variants, with or without
flaps, using this trick:

\medskip
\begin{verbatim}
\ifcat$\CropFlap$
  % no flaps
\else
  \vbox to \textheight{\hsize\CropFlap
    Flap text
  }\hss
\fi
\end{verbatim}

\medskip

\cmg{thePageNumber}
Macro \cmd{thePageNumber} is used to print the page number together with the crop mark text. We have
already shownd that it may be suppressed by the \opt{nopagenumbers} option. Another possibility is
to redefine it. We can \eg. define the book title with the \opt{croptitle} option and use the
text ``Cover'' instead of the page number when typesetting the cover. Usage of this macro is also
demonstrated in Figure~\ref{cover}.

\section{Customizing crop styles}
This section is intended for real \TeX perts. The package tries to provide a lot of options that
enable to customize the default crop style. Try to live with them because here you are touching the
very guts of the package. If you squeeze them badly, your document will suffer from strange
problems the source of which will be difficult to trace. However, if you like tough challenges and
your stomach is strong enough, then read on, but remember, you have been warned.

You ask for a different crop style by the \opt{cropstyle} option as described in
section~\ref{cropstyle} on page~\pageref{cropstyle}. Assume that you load the package with:

\medskip
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[cropmarks,cropstyle=special,...]{zwpagelayout}
\end{verbatim}

\cmg{cropstyle@special}
You will then have to define macro \cmd{cropstyle@special}. The package first patches the footer in
all page styles. A zero-width, zero-height, zero-depth box is added to the beginning of the footer.
The actual point is set to the lower left corner of the paper as defined by \cmd{paperheight} and
\cmd{paperwidth}. If \opt{nobleedclip} was not used, the area outside the bleed box is erased. The
current color is set according to \opt{cropcolor} option and the font is selected. Afterwards the
\cmd{cropstyle@special} macro is called.

As already noted, the intention is to discourage users from writing their own crop styles. We will
therefore only mention that the package defines a few useful macros that can be used in the crop
style definition. If your temptation to design your own crop style is really strong, you should
better study the package internals yourself.
