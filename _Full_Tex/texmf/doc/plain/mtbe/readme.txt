The six files in the MTBE package (not counting this one)
are used in the book `Mathematical TeX by Example'
by Arvind Borde [(c) 1993, Academic Press]. They may be
copied, distributed and used freely. If they are edited
in any way, however, they should be renamed first.

The six files are

    bookform.tex
    eightpt.tex
    eulconc.tex
    outform.tex   
    stdpage.tex   
    utility.tex

The first few lines of each file say what it (the file) does.
