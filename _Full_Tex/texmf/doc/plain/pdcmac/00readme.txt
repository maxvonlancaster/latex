	PDCMAC, a collection of macros for plain TeX documents.
		      Release 1.0 -- Spring 1995

This is collection of TeX definition files which may be useful for
setting documents using plain TeX (as opposed to more complex formats
like LaTeX).  See "install.txt" for installation hints.

This software may be used and distributed without fee under certain
conditions.  While I would like it to be useful, I cannot offer any
guarantee or warranty.  See "pdcguide.tex" for more information.

Please send reports of problems, comments and suggestions to the address
below.  If you find pdcmac useful or amusing, please send me a pretty
postcard.
