Thu Apr  6 12:32:28 1995  Damian Cugley  <pdc@booth35.ecs>

	* pinstall: Created a shellscript `pinstall' to replace `install'
	command on systems without GNU `install'.  Trying to keep track of
	all the stupid variants of `install' is pointlessly difficult.

	* makefile.in (install): much simplified by assuming either GNU
	"install" or my "pinstall".  Changed "mkdirhier" ro "pmkdir" at
	the same time.  Added manpages for the three shellscripts included
	with the package.
	
	* pdcmisc.dtx (section{PDCIMTH}): Added version ID \message.

Tue Feb 28 10:17:40 1995  Damian Cugley  <pdc@boothp1.ecs>

	* pdcsty.dtx: Removed attempts to make a Concrete style; there
	really doesn't seem to be much point.  Put more of the common code
	in pdc{lft,doc}1.tex.

	* pdcguide.tex: reorganized sections, expanded user guide and
	installation sections.

Mon Feb 27 14:43:43 1995  Damian Cugley  <pdc@boothp1.ecs>

	takes an argukent for the width of the completed columns; instead
	one should enclose \rigidbalance in \hbox to ...{...}.  Eliminated
	some variables (\RGDfirstcol etc.).

	*depth* of topbox and partialpage as well as height.

	* pdccode.dtx: New file, which generates tmp.tex (the Makefile

	* pdcoput.dtx (section{How to make one column}): Change to just
