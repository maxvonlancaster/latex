Before you report an error please check that The problem is with
ALaTeX and not LaTeX.  Try reproducing the problem with LaTeX.  If you
can, the problem is with LaTeX, so please see the file bugs.txt in the
LaTeX distribution.

If you think you have found a bug in ALaTeX, please send a full report
including the relevant .tex and .log files by email to Matt Swift
