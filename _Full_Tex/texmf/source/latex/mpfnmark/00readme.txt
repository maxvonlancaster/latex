The mpfnmark Package

Author: W. Kowarschick (kowa@informatik.tu-muenchen.de)

The mpfnmark package provides the command \mpfootnotemark,
which can be used in the same way as \footnotemark. The difference 
betwee these two macros is that within minipage environments the latter 
uses the standard footnote marker style (defined by \thefootnote), 
while the new command uses the minipage footnote marker style (defined
by \thempfootnote).
