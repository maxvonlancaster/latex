                    WK LaTeX Software Error Reports
 
                           27 November 1996

ERROR REPORTS

Before you report an error please check that:

 * Your LaTeX system is not more than one year old.  New LaTeX
   releases occur at 6 monthly intervals, thus your problem may
   have already been fixed.

 * The error is not already fixed by a patch added recently to the
   current distribution.  If you have access to a CTAN archive then
   you can easily check whether there is already a new version or a
   patch that fixes your problem; so please do so.

 * The error is not already mentioned in the documentation of the
   distribution, e.g., in a .dtx file (in this case it is a feature :-).

 * The error is not caused by software other than the core LaTeX
   software that is produced and maintained by the LaTeX3 project
   team or by a WK LaTeX software (please report problems with other
   software to the authors or suppliers of that software).

 * The error is not caused by using an obsolete version of any file or
   of other software. 

 * You are using the original version of all files, not one that has
   been modified elsewhere.

If you think you have found a genuine bug in a recent version of a
WK LaTeX software, please report it in the following way:

 * Prepare a *short* test file that clearly demonstrates your
   problem; see below for a discussion of `short'.

 * Run this file through latex to obtain the transcript file
   (often .log) since you will need to submit this file also.
 
 * Generate a bug report template by running the file
   latexbug.tex through LaTeX2e.

 * Fill in the spaces in the generated template file.
 
 * Include all necessary information, especially a complete input
   file, a complete transcript file, and all other files used (if they
   are not standard).

   Please check carefully to ensure that any non-standard files are
   essential to the bug; and remember that we cannot debug files not
   supplied by us.

   Any such non-standard files should be included in a `filecontents'
   environment at the start of your input file.

 * Please note that it is important to make the input file as short
   as possible since this will enable us to find and fix the error
   quickly.  It also helps us because then we can often use it as a test
   file for future releases.
   
   We would expect most files to be less than 60 lines, and very
   rarely to be longer than 100 lines.
   
   This can often be achieved by defining a command to be some
   arbitrary text and using this several times if it is necessary to
   generate longer bits of text.

Error reports concerning UNCHANGED versions of WK LaTeX files
which are less than one year old should be sent by E-mail to:
