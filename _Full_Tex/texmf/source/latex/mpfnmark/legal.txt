WARRANTY
========

There is no warranty for WK LaTeX, to the extent permitted by applicable
law.  Except when otherwise stated in writing, the WK LaTeX project
provides the program `as is' without warranty of any kind, either
expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is
with you.  Should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of
all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
will the WK LaTeX project, or any of the individual authors named above,
be liable to you for damages, including any general, special,
incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the
program or out of inability to use the program (including but not
limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses
sustained by you or by third parties as a result of a failure of the
program to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or
other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.


DISTRIBUTION
============

Redistribution of unchanged files is allowed provided that all files
listed in the file manifest.txt are distributed, including this file.

If you receive only some of these files from someone, complain!


However, if these files are distributed by established suppliers as
part of a complete TeX distribution on low capcity media such as
`floppy disks', and the structure of the distribution would make it
difficult to distribute the whole set of files, then *those parties
only* are allowed to distribute just some of the files, provided that:

 * their distribution includes a fully functional LaTeX system or
   enables the receiver to set up a fully functional LaTeX system;

 * their distribution contains all the documentation concerning the
   system in general, such as the *guide.tex files;

 * it is clearly stated how the user can get a complete
   distribution including all the files listed in manifest.txt, on
   request, from that supplier (*not* from us).

Note that this permission to distribute is not granted to the end user.


The distribution of changed versions of certain files included in the
LaTeX system, and the reuse of code from those files, are allowed
under the following restrictions:

 * It is allowed only if the legal notice in the file does not
   expressly forbid it.
 
   See below, under "Conditions on individual files", for a complete
   list of those classes of files which are exceptions.
 
 * You rename the file before you make any changes to it, unless the
   file explicitly says that renaming is not required. Any such changed
   files should be distributed under conditions that ensure that those
   files, and any files derived from them, will never be redistributed
   under the names used by the original files in the LaTeX distribution
   or in the WK LaTeX distribution.
 
 * You change the `identification string' to clearly indicate that the
   file is not part of the WK LaTeX system or the standard system.

   This `identification string' is in the optional argument of
   whichever of the following three commands appears in the file:
   \ProvidesClass, \ProvidesFile, \ProvidesPackage.

 * You change the `error report address' so that we do not get error
   reports for files not maintained by us.

 * You acknowledge the source and authorship of the original version
   in the modified file.

The above restrictions are not intended to prohibit, and hence do
not apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it
becomes identical to the latest version of that file in the 
WK LaTeX system.
