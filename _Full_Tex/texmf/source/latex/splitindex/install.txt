		SplitIndex Installation Guide

			   2009-03-18


INTRODUCTION
============

If you know how to install LaTeX packages and how to install binary
programs, just do it. If you don't know, read the following. If you
are using Linux-i386 or OpenBSD-i386 or another Unix like environment
with installed Gnu fileutils and installed Gnu-C-Compiler, you may try
install.sh for installation. See

    ./install.sh --help

for more information. If you don't have GCC, Linux-i386 or
OpenBSD-i386 you may also use install.sh, but you have to compile
and link splitindex.c before. See the splitidx manual for this.

But you may also try the following step by step installation:

HOW TO INSTALL SplitIndex FROM A TDS-ARCHIVE
============================================

Some distributors may use a SplitIndex TDS-archive for distributing
SplitIndex.  SplitIndex TDS-archive may be installed very easily.
The SplitIndex TDS-archive has following contents:

  +- doc/
  |  +- latex/
  |     +- splitindex/
  |        +- install.txt
  |        +- README
  |        +- splitidx.pdf
  |        +- splitindex.1
  +- tex/
  |  +- latex/
  |     +- splitindex/
  |        +- splitidx.sty
  |        +- splitindex.tex
  +- scripts/
  |  +- splitindex/
  |     +- perl/
  |        +- splitindex.pl
  +- source/
     +- latex/
        +- splitindex/
           +- install.sh
	   +- install.txt
           +- manifest.txt
           +- README
           +- splitidx.dtx
           +- splitidx.ins
           +- splitindex.1
           +- splitindex.c
	   +- splitindex.class
	   +- splitindex.exe
           +- splitindex.java
	   +- splitindex-Linux-i386
	   +- splitindex-OpenBSD-i386
           +- splitindex.pl
           +- splitindex.tex

If you don't have such an archive, continue reading at 1st step of ``HOW TO
GENERATE THE splitidx PACKAGE''.  If you have such an archive - we will use
the file name ``splitindex.tds.zip'' in the following - you may continue 
with:

A)   Have a look where your LaTeX Distribution searchs for files. 
     With teTeX you can ask kpathsea for this, e.g. using a unix
     shell:

	kpsexpand \$TEXMFLOCAL

     to use the local texmf tree or:

	kpsexpand \$HOMETEXMF

     to use your private texmf tree. Following uses ``<TEXMF>'' to 
     be a synonym for the texmf tree you want to use.

B)   Extract splitindex.tds.zip at <TEXMF> with all the subdirectories of
     the splitindex.tds.zip but without generating additional 
     subdirectories, e.g., using:

        cd <TEXMF>
	unzip splitindex.tds.zip

     or any other zip extraction programm.

C)   Continue with 5th to 9th step of ``HOW TO INSTALL THE BINARIES''.

D)   Call the program, which is used to update the filename data
     base, e.g., texhash or mktexlsr if you are using teTeX/TeX Live.

E)   Read ``HOW TO TEST YOUR INSTALLATION'' at the end of this 
     documentation.


HOW TO GENERATE THE splitidx PACKAGE
====================================

You need this only, if you don't have a SplitIndex TDS-archive, but want
to install SplitIndex from a basic SplitIndex distribution.  If you have 
already done the SplitIndex TDS-archive installation discribed above, you
should skip this section.

1st) Process splitidx.ins with TeX or LaTeX, e.g. using the following
     input at a command shell (e.g. bash or command.com):

	latex splitidx.ins

     Maybe you'll be asked, if you want to overwrite existing files. 
     Answer this question with yes.

2nd) Have a look where your LaTeX Distribution searchs for files. 
     With teTeX you can ask kpathsea for this, e.g. using a unix
     shell:

	kpsexpand \$TEXMFLOCAL

     to use the local texmf tree or:

	kpsexpand \$HOMETEXMF

     to use your private texmf tree. Following uses ``<TEXMF>'' to 
     be a synonym for the texmf tree you want to use.

3rd) Create folder <TEXMF>/tex/latex/splitindex (at Windows:
     <TEXMF>\tex\latex\splitindex), if it doesn't exist. Copy 
     splitidx.sty to this folder.

4th) Call the program, which is used to update the filename data
     base, e.g. texhash or mktexlsr if you are using teTeX/TeX Live.


HOW TO INSTALL THE BINARIES
===========================

You need only one of the binaries splitindex (compiled from splitindex.c),
splitindex.class (compiled from splitindex.java) or splitindex.pl (using a
perl interpreter).  Following steps will install all these binaries.
Please do them all, before asking for support.

5th) Rename the suitable binary (e.g. splitindex-Linux-i386, if you're
     using Linux-i386) to splitindex or compile splitindex.c to generate
     a binary named splitindex using e.g.
         gcc -O3 -Wall -o splitindex splitindex.c
     or
         gcc -O3 -Wall -DNO_LONGOPT -o splitindex splitindex.c

6th) Copy splitindex.java to the binary search path of SUN JAVA
     1.4.1.

7th) Copy splitindex.pl and splitindex or splitindex.exe somewhere to
     your binary search path (ask environment variable PATH).

8th) Copy the manual page splitindex.1 to your manual seach path. If you are
     using Linux or OpenBSD, this may be, e.g., /usr/local/man/man1/ (ask
     environment variable MANPATH).

9th) Copy splitindex.tex to the same location you've copied
     splitidx.sty to and do 4th step again.


HOW TO GENERATE THE MANUAL
==========================

10th) process splitidx.dtx with LaTeX to generate the user manual of
      splitidx and SplitIndex, e.g. using the following input at a 
      command shell:

	latex splitidx.dtx
	latex splitidx.dtx
	mkindex splitidx
	latex splitidx.dtx

      or (if you do not have the mkindex script):

	latex splitidx.dtx
	latex splitidx.dtx
	makeindex -s gind.ist splitidx
	makeindex -s gglo.ist -o splitidx.gls splitidx.glo
	latex splitidx.dtx

      You may print the resulting splitidx.dvi. If you prefere PDF 
      files, use pdflatex instead of latex.

11th) read the manual you produced at 10th step.


HOW TO TEST YOUR INSTALLATION
=============================

Use the following LaTeX source to test the installation. See
splitidx.dvi or splitidx.pdf to see how to do this.

\documentclass{article} %  We use \Class{article} class ...
\usepackage{splitidx} % ... and the \Package{splitidx} package
\makeindex %  And we want index generation
\usepackage{hyperref}
%  We define 4 indices:
\newindex[General Index]{idx} %  Name and shortcut of the 1st index
\newindex[Index of Animals]{ani} %  ... 2nd index
\newindex[Index of Fruits]{fru} %  ... 3rd index
\newindex[Index of Vegetables]{veg} % ... \dots\ 4th index

\begin{document}
Apples\sindex[fru]{apple} %  an entry to fru index
and oranges\sindex[fru]{orange} %  an entry to fru index
are fruits\sindex{fruits}. %  an implicite entry to idx index
Tomatos\sindex[veg]{tomato} %  an entry to veg index
are vegetables\index{vegetables}. %  an implicite entry to idx index
Cats\sindex[ani]{cat} %  an entry to ani index
are animals\sindex[idx]{animals}. %  an explicite entry to idx index

\twocolumn[%
 \section*{Indices}%
 \markboth{Indices}{Indices}%
]
\printsubindex* %  print all indices
\end{document}
